1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,688
So we'll get started with functions of
several variables.

2
00:00:03,688 --> 00:00:09,690
So there's two types roughly that

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,920
we can talk about, and it just has to do
with what the output of the function is.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,980
So I'm going to start out with the

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,500
simplest one which is the scalar valued
function.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,110
Under a Scalar Valued Function just takes
values in the real numbers.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,230
So you put in if it's of several variables
two or

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,330
more inputs and you get one number out

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,340
and some would call that a Scalar Valued
Function.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,845
And the notation I'm going to use for that
is

11
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:40,650
f', that's the name of my function from rn
into r.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,930
So rn just means that there are n real
numbers that are taken as input, so

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,420
this is a function of n variables.
And output is a real number so it's a,

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,340
a single variable output, a scalar
function.

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:02,160
And so you can think of that just as this.
So I have inputs x1, x2, up to xn.

16
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,110
Each one of the x's is a real number.
And then the output y is a real number.

17
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,360
And so the example I'm going to use, for,
for this week's

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,620
lectures is, Black Scholes pricing formula
for a European call option.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,660
And so hopefully when we look at this with
all of its

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,110
pieces finally, it's going to, sort of,
become more apparent why we

21
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,980
had to spend so much time learning how to
take derivatives of

22
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,340
little indefinite integrals, things like
that, product rule, chain rule and so on.

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,170
So the inputs for this formula.

24
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,810
Are going to be s, which is the price of
the stock.

25
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,390
Sigma which is the volatility of the
stock.

26
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,290
K is the strike price, so this is, you
know, what

27
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,880
I'm going to be able to get for my if I

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,855
decide to exercise my option in the future
R is the

29
00:01:58,855 --> 00:02:02,480
risk-free interest rate, so that's
risk-free interest rate just on money.

30
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,590
T is the maturity, and this is, the way to
think about

31
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,670
capital T, and there, there'll be a little
t somewhere here, too.

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,040
they're both dates,

33
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,190
so.

34
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,640
You know, this could be next Tuesday and
little

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,910
t, generally we're going to think of that
as today.

36
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,010
And then q is continuous dividend rate.

37
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,330
If the, if the asset pays dividends then
you want to

38
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,600
take those dividends and figure out what
the continuous rate would be.

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,060
And q is going to represent that number.

40
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,920
And then this is the formula so, generally
the, the inputs

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,030
you think of it as a function with two
main inputs.

42
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,330
So the, the price of the asset s, and then
the current time t.

43
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,460
And, generally, you can almost think of
this as one

44
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,010
input because at a certain time, like
right now, I can

45
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,980
look at the market and see what the price
of

46
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,040
the asset is so these, these are, sort of,
tied together

47
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,220
in, in a certain sense.

48
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:16,460
And, so, the formula then is s times e to
the minus q capital T minus little t.

49
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,030
And so this is where it becomes important
to think of the t's as dates.

50
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:26,760
So, if I say next Tuesday is capital t and
right now is little t.

51
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,200
So, that would be eight days in the
future.

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,100
So, when I do capital t next Tuesday minus
today that's going to give me eight.

53
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,670
So, This quantity, capital T minus little
T, you can think about that as the time

54
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,310
left in chill maturity, and as time moves
forward, that's actually getting shorter.

55
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,620
And then you can see that this formula is
going to simplify a bit

56
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,750
if you have a non-dividend paying asset,
this q is just going to be zero.

57
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,680
And so you'll have e to the zero.

58
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,860
And this whole piece that I have
highlighted will disappear.

59
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,740
It'll just become one.

60
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,240
[COUGH].

61
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,170
So I'm

62
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,368
going to multiply that times Fi.

63
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:11,640
And remember, Fi was this function we
defined as the integral

64
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,670
of the standard normal density from minus
infinity up to its argument.

65
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,530
So this value here.

66
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,710
So Fi of d1 of st.

67
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,840
So d1 is going to be another function that
we have to evaluate.

68
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:31,730
And then I'm going to subtract k times, so
here r is the interest rate, the risk free

69
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:37,590
interest rate times the time left until
maturity times Fi.

70
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,110
Again and now we have another function d 2
of st

71
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,650
and the, the form of d1 and d2 are down
here.

72
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,180
Again and now we have another function d2
of st.

73
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,090
And the form of d1 and d2 are down here so
I'll

74
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,970
have to wait until my slide disappears so
they're not exactly simple.

75
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,830
So the, the reason we want to write this
as Fi of d1 And fi of d2 is just if,

76
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,450
if I start plugging this whole expression
into these parenthesis the, the thing gets

77
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:07,570
quite unwildy.
And then d2 is just

78
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:13,820
equal to d1 minus sigma times the square
root of capital T minus little t.

79
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,080
And if you write down what that looks
like, if you plug in

80
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,910
this formula on the left for d1, all that
ends up changing is,

81
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,300
this plus here becomes a minus.

82
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,130
So that quite often, derivatives of d1 and

83
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,450
d2 are very similar to each other, they
differ

84
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,480
by a sign or not at all, depending on

85
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,590
what What you're taking the derivative
with respect to.

86
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,400
So in order to take a derivative of a
function of several

87
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,070
variables we, we have to define a new
concept called a partial derivative.

88
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,020
So I have a function from Rn into R.

89
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,460
And the partial derivative of F with
respect to the Jth, input, I'm going to

90
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,140
denote that as partial of F with respect
to Xj.

91
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,530
And that's

92
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,359
also going to be a function of N
variables.

93
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,030
[INAUDIBLE]

94
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,030
.

95
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,230
And we're going to define the partial
derivative, then, just

96
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,640
to be this limit on the right hand side.

97
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,300
And if you look closely, all I'm doing is
I'm treating

98
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,370
everything except for x sub j as if it
were a constant.

99
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,550
So, I am leaving those the same, and then
I am using

100
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,170
just on the one variable I am interested
in so x of j.

101
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,300
I am going to use the definition of the
derivative

102
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,560
on that one particular p.

103
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,120
So, add h to that and then add then I will
subtract r, local our, our initial points.

104
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,370
So, this is the point where I am trying to
find the derivative.

105
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:54,150
And then I'm going to divide by h.
And then take the limit as h goes to zero.

106
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,900
And then we say that this has a derivative
if this limit exists, and is finite.

107
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,899
And in practice, the way we're going to
compute these.

108
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:11,790
we're just going to fix xk for every x
that's not equal to j.

109
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,050
So remember, I'm trying to compute the,
the jth partial derivative.

110
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,030
So I'm just going to treat xk, any other
variable, as if it's a constant.

111
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,270
And then just to differentiate f as if it
were a

112
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,890
function of one variable, and that one
var, variable being xj.

113
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,830
So, for example, if I let my function, so
I'm going to choose a function of two

114
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,500
variables and I have x squared y plus e to
the minus xy cubed.

115
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,160
And I want to take the derivative of this
function now.

116
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,040
I guess I should mention a little bit here
about notations so, when we are taking

117
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,210
a complete derivative with a function of
one

118
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,710
variable and I take its derivative I've
just

119
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:04,143
been using 'd by dx' And when I'm taking a
partial derivative, I use this funnier

120
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:08,730
symbol that it looks kind of like a twisty
D that' I'm just going to read as partial.

121
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,965
And so, because this is a sum of

122
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:16,280
two functions, I still have a linearity
property.

123
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,840
So, I can.

124
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,750
The, the derivative of a sum is the sum of
the derivative.

125
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,390
So this is going to be equal to the
derivative of

126
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,320
the first term plus the derivative of the
second term.

127
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,460
And then to take the derivative of this
piece

128
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,160
here with respect to x, I'm going to make
a substitution.

129
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,840
So I'm going to say minus xy cubed.

130
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,480
I'm going to call that U, I think that's
what I decided to do.

131
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,980
Yep.

132
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,060
So I can rewrite this like this.

133
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,380
So if I look at what happened in the first
term, since I'm taking the

134
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,200
partial derivative with respect to X, my
rule was treat Y like it's a constant.

135
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,890
So if Y is a constant, I can use my
formula that says.

136
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,750
C times x squared.

137
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,510
The derivative of that is equal to c times
the derivative of x squared.

138
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,060
So in this case, now, y is my constant.

139
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,250
So I can just say that's equal to y times
the derivative.

140
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,520
Sorry, y times the partial with respect to
x, of x squared.

141
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,830
And then, for the term on the right.

142
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,910
I'm taking the partial derivative of a

143
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,850
function of u, so partial derivative with
respect

144
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,930
to x of a function of x, so I have to use
the chain rule here.

145
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,570
And so the chain rule says that the
derivative of this is going to be the

146
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,479
derivative of my function of u times the
derivative of u with respect to x.

147
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:38,490
[INAUDIBLE]

148
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:38,490
.

149
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,300
So the derivative of e to the u is just e
to the u.

150
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,950
And then I still have to calculate this
partial u, partial x.

151
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,100
And I'll do that just by taking the

152
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,540
derivative of my substitution here with
respect to x.

153
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,630
And then, for the, for the first term,
that was pretty easy.

154
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,150
I just used the power rule to say

155
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,980
that the derivative, derivative of x
squared was 2x.

156
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,499
So I end up with 2xy.
So the

157
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:09,070
partial derivative of my substitution with
respect to

158
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,880
x is just going to be minus y cubed.

159
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,840
So that's just minus y cubed times x and
using the power rule,

160
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,020
and then I just have to reverse my
substitution.

161
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,660
So I am going to replace this u.

162
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,030
Right here with minus x y cubed

163
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,640
and I end up with 2 xy minus y cubed times
e to the minus xy cubed.

164
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,140
[COUGH]

165
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,820
So that was the derivative with respect to
x.

166
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,790
We can repeat now for the derivative with
respect to y.

167
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,950
So I'm going to set this up exactly the
same way.

168
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,758
Use the linearity property to write.

169
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:58,470
This is two, the sum of two derivatives.
Make the same substitution.

170
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,080
But this time, when I look at the, the
first

171
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,460
term, now I'm taking the derivative with
respect to y.

172
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,550
So it's the x squared I can bring out.

173
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,710
So I have x squared times the partial with
respect to y of just y.

174
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,390
And then on the right hand term I have
partial with respect to y of e to the u.

175
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,770
So by the change rule I'm going to have to
multiply the

176
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,150
derivative of e to the u, times partial u
partial y

177
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,660
And again I am just going to take the
derivative,

178
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,310
but this time with respect to y of my
substitution.

179
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:41,690
So that gives me my chain rule derivative,
so I have du dy equals minus 3 xy

180
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,540
squared, so that's here just treating x as
a

181
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,669
constant and taking the derivative of
minus y cubed.

182
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,750
Using the power rule.

183
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,120
And then I just have to plug everything
back in and I

184
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,100
get the partial derivative of F of X with
respect to Y.

185
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,650
And so essentially what we're going to
have to do to get a full idea of

186
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,250
what the derivative of F of X Looks like
is where we need every partial derivative

187
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:23,270
and so if f is a function of n variables
with one output.

188
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,820
So the output is a real number then I

189
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,099
am going to define something called the
gradient of a F.

190
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,600
Which is denoted sometimes by capital d
times f of x.

191
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,270
So here we think of capital d kind of the
same way I think of d by dx.

192
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,420
It's a operator, so it means take

193
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,499
the gradient of the function f of x.

194
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,630
And the gradient is just going to be an

195
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,074
array of the partial derivatives of f of
x.

196
00:12:55,074 --> 00:13:00,910
So each one of these terms, so each one of
these elements

197
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:06,820
of the array df Dx 1, or partial F partial
X one, that's a function of N variables.

198
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,040
Partial F partial X two, that's also a
function of N variables.

199
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,090
And

200
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:22,200
then one last thing that we might have to
deal with is a function of one

201
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,140
or more variables That takes values in a

202
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,020
multidimensional space is called a vector
value function.

203
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,350
And so in this case what I'm after is, I

204
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,850
have, say, two inputs, and my function
gives me two outputs.

205
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,240
And so in this case, I'm going to use the

206
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:47,020
function, sorry, the notation, F from Rn
into Rm.

207
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,870
And so this just means that f is the
function that takes n arguments.

208
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,400
So there are n inputs to this function.

209
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,870
And then there are m outputs to this
function.

210
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:03,919
And the way to think about this is, you
have f of my n inputs

211
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:12,084
I can have m a different sort of
sub-functions, each one of them returns

212
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:19,020
the well, element one, two, three up to m
of the vector of outputs.

213
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,590
And so in this case, when we try and make
the gradient.

214
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,390
We're going to have, instead of just an

215
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,470
array that only has one row, we're
going to have,

216
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,680
one row with n columns for each for each
element of the output.

217
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,219
So now my gradient is going to end up
being an array with m rows and n columns.

218
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,940
So there are N times N first order partial
derivatives, which is a lot to work with.
