1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,590
So, now we'll look at higher order partial
derivatives.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:13,240
So, remember for a function of a single
variable I could say d squared by dx

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,659
squared of f of x when I wanted to talk
about the second derivative of f of x.

4
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,900
And what I meant, what I mean by this
notation is take the

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,480
derivative of f of x with respect to x one
time, the thing

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,610
in the square brackets here, that's going
to be another function of x

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,569
and then I'm going to take the derivative
of that, again with respect to x.

8
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,820
And then I can also use the notation.

9
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,190
So, the derivative of x with respect to x
I can call, sorry.

10
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:48,330
Yeah.

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,380
Derivative of x with respect to x.
So, I'll call that f prime.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,739
And if I take the derivative of that
again, we use the notation f double prime.

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,520
So for a function of several variables,
I'm going to do

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,470
pretty much the same thing, except just
with partial derivatives.

15
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,230
So for instance, if I wanted to take the
derivative with respect to x so the

16
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,510
second derivative with respect to x,
second partial

17
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,950
derivative with respect to x of a
function.

18
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,810
E to the xy.

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,660
So, maybe highlight that part at least.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,650
What I mean is take the derivative take
the partial

21
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,540
with respect to x of e to the xy.

22
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,660
That's going to give me another function
of x and y.

23
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,180
And then take the partial derivative of
that function with respect to x again.

24
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,890
And so if I just go ahead and evaluate
that, I'm going to end up with y

25
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:47,970
times e to the xy, by taking the
derivative of this with respect to x once.

26
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,800
And then another y will pop out when I
take the second derivative,

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,550
so I end up with y squared e to the xy So
there's a bad

28
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,645
example of how not to do the chain rule,
by just doing it all explicitly.

29
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:02,490
Hm-mmm.

30
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,540
And then similarly if I want to take the
second partial,

31
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,260
second partial derivative of e to the xy
with respect to y.

32
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,880
I'm going to do exactly the same thing,
except I'm just

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,960
going to have partial y's in the
denominator And in this

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,420
case, this is such a simple function I
could just

35
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,740
relabel the x and y, so we can kind of
skip

36
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,330
the computation and just see that the
output is going to

37
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,800
be, in this case, x squared times e to the
xy.

38
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,260
But for functions of several variables
there's now also

39
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,110
the The possibility of something called a
mixed partial derivative.

40
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,400
So I'm going to keep the same idea as I,
as I had in middle

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,960
section of the slide where I take the
derivative with respect say the partial

42
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,590
derivative of my function with respect to
one of the variables and repeat except

43
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,190
when I repeat I can take the partial
derivative With respect to a different

44
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,060
one of the variables.

45
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,270
So in this case, I'm going to take the
partial derivative,

46
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,990
first with respect to y, and then with
respect to x.

47
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,990
So you can kind of think of this thing
here as an operator.

48
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,020
And so, it's going to do something to this
function.

49
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,269
And the part that's closest to the
function that's going to happen first.

50
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:21,760
[INAUDIBLE]

51
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:21,760
.

52
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,820
So if I were to write this out using
slightly longer form.

53
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,770
When I say partial squared, partial x,
partial y.

54
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,210
I mean, first take the partial derivative
with respect to y of my function.

55
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,120
That's going to give me another function
of x and y.

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,450
And I'm going to take the partial
derivative

57
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,430
with respect to x of that function.

58
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,820
So, here, I've just evaluated the first
partial with respect to y.

59
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,710
So we got the same thing we got up here.

60
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,650
But now, this time, it's going to be
slightly more complicated.

61
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,780
Because I'm going to take the derivative
of this now with respect to x.

62
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,860
So now this is a product of two functions
of x.

63
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,360
So.

64
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,480
X is the first function, and then e to the
x y

65
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,960
is my second function, so I have to use
the product rule.

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,650
And so again just to make this all fit

67
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,320
on one slide, I've skipped, probably some
essential work.

68
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,960
But I hope it's, I hope it's correct.

69
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,970
So I have the derivative of the first
function times the second function.

70
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,320
So the derivative of x is going to just be
one.

71
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,150
So the first term in the product rule is
going to to be e to the xy.

72
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,410
And plus the first funtion times the
derivative of the second.

73
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,910
So I'm going to take X times the partial
with respect

74
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,800
to x, of e to the x y.
We already worked that out above, too.

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,690
So I have e to the x y plus x y e to the x
y.

76
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,970
Oops, going to write down here.

77
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,789
Okay, my arrow's not working anymore.

78
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,360
There it goes.

79
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,360
And somehow this is going to probably
bring up the question what

80
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,960
is the relationship between, so here I'm
doing the mixed partial.

81
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,800
Taking the partial derivative with respect
to y

82
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,050
and then the partial derivative with
respect to x.

83
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,250
X.

84
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,310
And here it's just the other way around.

85
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,810
First, with respect to x and then with
respect to y.

86
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:33,170
So we already saw that if I did it y first
then x, this is the function that I got.

87
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,170
[INAUDIBLE]

88
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,670
.
And

89
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,460
now let's look at what happens when I do
it with respect to x first.

90
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,030
And then with respect to y.

91
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,870
So first, I'm going to take the partial
derivative

92
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,270
with respect to x of e to the xy.

93
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,780
And that's just going to give me y times e
to the xy.

94
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,860
And now again I have to use the product
rule to take the derivative of this.

95
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,770
So it's, the derivative of the first
function,

96
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,740
so the derivative of y with respect to y,

97
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,390
is just one, times the second function, so
that's where this e to the xy comes from.

98
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,330
Plus, the first function, so that's my y
here.

99
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,530
Times the derivative of the second
function.

100
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,740
And we've already worked this out, this
was just x times e to the xy.

101
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,960
So I end up with e to the xy plus xye to
the xy, which is what

102
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,100
we got for the first one.

103
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,300
And so when I have this.

104
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,700
Sort of, very symmetric with respect to
differentiation function.

105
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,980
I find that the mixed partials are equal.

106
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,970
So, it doesn't matter if I do dx dy, or dy
dx, I get the same, same result.

107
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,770
So, but this function that I chose, it was

108
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,130
easy to work with in terms of taking its
derivatives.

109
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,140
But, because of this symmetry, maybe we
should try it with a, a little

110
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,249
bit more complicated function to see what
happens.

111
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,440
So I think I chose this function from the,
from the text book.

112
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,630
it was not fun to take the derivatives of
this.

113
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,189
So to get the second partial with respect
to y and then respect to

114
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:20,643
x, first I'll start out by taking the
derivative of this with respect to y.

115
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,210
So let's see.

116
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,540
So the first thing I'm going to do is make
my

117
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:31,550
u substitution, just to avoid making
mistakes with the chain rule.

118
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,340
Usually what, what gets me is the minus
sign up here, because

119
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,400
that's, if there's a minus sign here and a
minus sign here,

120
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,830
for some reason I tend to have about a 50%
chance of missing one of those.

121
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,170
We're getting it wrong I suppose.

122
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:43,670
[SOUND]

123
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,400
So,

124
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,080
I also did the partial derivative with
respect to y

125
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,450
of the first term here just because it was
easy.

126
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,900
So by the power rule the y is just y to
the zero.

127
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,910
So I have x squared.

128
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,100
Plus the partial derivative with respect
to y of e to the u.

129
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,790
So that begs for the chain rule.

130
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,840
And so that's just going to be the
derivative of e

131
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,900
to the u with respect to u, which luckily
is ease,

132
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,690
e to the u, times the partial derivative
of u with respect to y, which

133
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,780
I'm going to get just exactly like the
first

134
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,220
example by taking the derivative of my
substitution.

135
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,860
So let's see what I end up with here.

136
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,790
So I have x squared minus 3 xy squared e
to the minus xy cubed.

137
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,190
And in fact since we've already taken the
derivative of this

138
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,360
a few slides ago, I didn't have to do this
bit.

139
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,320
I could've just used the derivative I'd
already computed.

140
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,460
And so now I want to take the derivative

141
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,020
of this guy, the partial derivative with
respect to x.

142
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,210
So again I'll do the, the first term,

143
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,860
just because the derivative of x squared
is easy.

144
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,090
By the power rule I just get two x.

145
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:08,440
And then this minus is going to appear
here.

146
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,340
And then I'll take the derivative of this
term by treating it as two functions.

147
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,450
3 x y squared, and e to the minus x y
cubed.

148
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,959
And so I'm taking the derivative now with
respect to x.

149
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,800
So, the derivative of the first term,
that's easy.

150
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,580
That just got x to the 1 so the x is going
to go away so I end up with 3y squared

151
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,030
times the second function.
And plus the first function so there's my

152
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:44,190
3xy squared times the derivative of the
second function

153
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,240
[SOUND]

154
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,170
And so, just, plugging all of this in and
distributing this minus sign,

155
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,850
gives me this, and now all I have to do is
plug in, what

156
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,210
u is, and what partial derivative of u
with respect to x is, which I got just

157
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:09,820
Again, by taking the derivative with
respect to x this time.

158
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,410
And so, I end up with this somewhat
unhappy looking formula here.

159
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,090
But, at least it's something that doesn't
look

160
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,810
like it's going to have a lot of symmetry.

161
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,700
Like if I changed the x and y, they
shouldn't be the same.

162
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,160
And so now we'll repeat the same
calculation,

163
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,320
but here I'm going to use x first.

164
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,650
So this time the last time I did y first,
and now this time I'll do x first.

165
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,330
So again the first term's going to be
pretty easy to do, so we'll just do that.

166
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,000
Second term I'm going to make my u
substitution,

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,290
so I can see myself using the chain rule.

168
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,150
So I'll let u equal minus x y cubed,
again.

169
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,360
So the first part, I'm treating y as a
constant, and then

170
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,540
taking the derivative of x squared, so the
power rule just says

171
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,940
that's going to be 2x, and then times y,
and then I need

172
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,290
to take the derivative with respect to x
of e to the u.

173
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,140
So by the chain rule, that's going to be e
to

174
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:15,510
the u, times the partial derivative of u
with respect to x.

175
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,700
Which again, I get just by taking the
derivative of my substitution.

176
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,200
And

177
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,610
now I need to take the partial derivative
of this with respect to y.

178
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,270
So again the first term is going to be
easy, that's

179
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,640
just y to the one, so that's going to be
two x.

180
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,490
And the second term I'm going to need to
use the product rule,

181
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,490
so the functions will be y cubed and e to
the u.

182
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,010
So, the product rule says it's derivative
of the first function,

183
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,690
so this is the derivative of Y cubed by
the power rule.

184
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,380
Times the second function, plus the first

185
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,060
function times the derivative of the
second function.

186
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,020
And so we've done this several times
already, so

187
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,180
just skip this line and just plug in the
results.

188
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,460
Oops, two times.

189
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,050
And so we get another Sort of unhappy
looking formula.

190
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,040
But I think on the next slide I put them

191
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,190
together, and those were actually the same
formulas both ways.

192
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,090
So that sort of gives us some hope that,
probably these

193
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,110
things are equal, regardless of what order
you take the derivative.

194
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,370
And.

195
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,040
If you take a more serious math class, you
can actually prove this.

196
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,750
I'm just going to give the, the statement
of

197
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,010
the theorem.

198
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,500
So, if all of the partial derivatives of
order k.

199
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,500
So, order k means how many times I've
taken a derivative.

200
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,520
So, if if I take the second

201
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,019
partial derivative, that's a derivative of
order two.

202
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,240
Of the function f of x exist and are
continuous.

203
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,810
Then the order in which the partial
derivatives of f of x of order at most k.

204
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,360
So, as long as I don't try to go beyond k.

205
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,580
Then the order that I do those derivatives
doesn't matter.

206
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,460
I'm going to get the same mixed partial.

207
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,770
And so, just like I made an array to hold,
the first

208
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,870
derivatives, I need to make an array now
to hold, the second derivatives.

209
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,740
And this array is going to be called the
Hessian

210
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,720
of f of x, and we can use the notation.

211
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,550
D squared so that two just

212
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,100
means essentially just take the derivative
twice.

213
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,910
But in this case because we're talking
about

214
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,100
functions, you know, so the first one has

215
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,920
n inputs, then I end up with the gradient
which

216
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,250
has n outputs, so that's a, a function
that has n

217
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,050
When I evaluate the gradient at one point
I get n results.

218
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,080
And then I'm going to take the derivative
of that again so

219
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,010
I'm going to get an n by n array of mixed
partial derivatives.

220
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,360
And so down the, the diagonal of the
array, so the diagonal for

221
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,880
some reason, when people say that, they
mean top left to bottom right.

222
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,640
this going up bottom left to top right.

223
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,100
It's also a diagonal but nobody means that
when they say diagonal.

224
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:19,220
So the diagonal elements are just going to
be taking the derivative,

225
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,900
the partial derivative of the function
with respect to the same variable twice.

226
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,200
So In that case, I can kind of compact
this notation.

227
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,960
This means partial x one, partial x one.

228
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,100
But it's the same thing, so I just write
it as squared.

229
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,060
And then in the off-diagonal elements

230
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,560
[COUGH],

231
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,540
the, the first row, I take the derivative
with respect to x one.

232
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,076
The partial derivative with respect to x
one first.

233
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:48,410
So the x one is going on the right side,
here.

234
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,590
And then I take the partial derivative
with respect to x whatever column I'm in.

235
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:58,630
So if I'm in the second column, I take the
partial derivative with respect to x two.

236
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,570
If it's the nth column, I take the partial
derivative with respect to x n.

237
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:05,880
And,

238
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,090
remember, because of the theorem that I
had on

239
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,040
the last slide, this function here and
this function here,

240
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,010
so this is x1x2 and this is x2x1, so

241
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,115
if this function is well behaved, then
these two terms will be

242
00:15:26,115 --> 00:15:36,115
equal.
