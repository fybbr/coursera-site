1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,920
So now I'll talk about some extensions of

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,960
the chain rule for functions of several
variables.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,590
So suppose f of x is a differentiable
function.

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,750
And so here I'm, I'm starting out again
just as functions

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,150
of one variable and then we'll try and
generalize from there.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,450
And x is equal to g of t, where g of t is
also a differentiable function.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:27,950
And

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,060
I can think of f as a function of t just
by, you know.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,000
First I'll calculate x by evaluating g at

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,089
t, and then I'll evaluate f at that
number.

11
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,390
And so then by the, this is the, the
single

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,650
variable chain rule, I have derivative of
f with respect

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,740
to t is equal to derivative of f with
respect

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,530
to x times the derivative of x with
respect to t.

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,990
And so if I want to evaluate the log of
cosine of t.

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,330
With respect to t, so here, log is playing
the

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,040
role of f, and cosine is playing the role
of g.

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,300
So f is equal to log of x, and x is equal
to cosine of t.

19
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,110
So x is equal to g of t is equal to cosine
of t.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,220
So to take the derivative of this I'm just
going to,

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,430
it's going to be a straightforward
application of the chain rule.

22
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,320
So the derivative of f with respect to x,
so that's the logarithm.

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,100
The derivative of the logarithm is just
one over x.

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,310
Oh and I guess this reminds me of
something, so.

25
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,020
Somebody asked me after class last time

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,635
what the difference between log and
natural log?

27
00:01:47,635 --> 00:01:49,200
And, so for this class I actually

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,110
mean the same thing.

29
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,320
So when I write log just like this, I mean
log with a base e.

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,210
If I want it to be a log with a different
base I'll write sub base, so it will be.

31
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,670
Log and the subscript ten would be what
your

32
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,570
log button on, you know, old calculators
used to do.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,460
I'm doing it this way just because later
in

34
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,520
the course we'll be using a program called
R.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,820
And when you use the log function in R, it

36
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,130
calculates a natural logger rhythm even
though it's spelled log.

37
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,090
Generally, in mathematics when you get
sort of

38
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,220
higher, further along, l, o, g means
natural log.

39
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,250
And in engineering you have l n for
natural logarithm.

40
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,616
So, 1 over x is the derivative of log x,
when

41
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:48,420
the log function is using e as its base.

42
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,940
So here, when I take the derivative of f,
I get 1

43
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,430
over x, and then I have to multiply that
times dx dt.

44
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,200
And so here.

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,710
G of t or dx dt is just going to be

46
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,400
the derivative of cosign of t with respect
to t.

47
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,850
So that's minus sine of t.

48
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,900
So then I end up with minus 1 over cosine
of t so x

49
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,570
remember is cosine of t times the sine of
t and that's equal to.

50
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,060
So sine of t divided by cosine of t,
that's the tangent of t and so then it's

51
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,590
negative, so I get minus tangent of t.

52
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,246
So now let's see what happens when we have
a function of two variables.

53
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:35,390
So, f of xy,

54
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,890
it's differentiable again.

55
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,760
This time I'm going to define x to be a
function g of t.

56
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,610
And y to be a function h of t.

57
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,520
Where g and h are also both differentiable
functions.

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,640
But in this specific case now, f is a
function of two variables.

59
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,670
But g.

60
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,550
And h are both functions of t, so f of xy
is

61
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,570
actually only a function of one variable.

62
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,960
It's sort of like in the pricing formula I
had in the

63
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,917
first set of slides, I have this d one and
d two.

64
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,129
They are both functions of the same
variables.

65
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,020
I guess that'll be a better example when I
let,

66
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,210
g and h be functions of more than one
variable.

67
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,600
But essentially what you are sort of doing
is you're getting to

68
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,660
a function of t by way of a function of x
and y.

69
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,590
And so I can think of f of xy.

70
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,630
If I evaluate, so if I replace the x just
by g of t, which gives me my

71
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,530
x coordinate, and by h of t, y by h of t,
which gives me my y coordinate.

72
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:51,760
Then, this function here is really just a
function of t, and its derivative.

73
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,390
So here, I'm getting kind of clever with
the d' s and the partial symbols.

74
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,190
So, because f is only a function of one
variable

75
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,880
t, I can actually write a complete
derivative for f.

76
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,950
But the way I'm going to get that is I'm
going

77
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,938
to take the partial derivative of f with
respect to x.

78
00:05:11,938 --> 00:05:15,530
So that's going to be a function of x and
y but

79
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,730
then by the chain rule I have to multiply
this by.

80
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,820
So this is going to be d u d t.
So g prime of t.

81
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,560
So whatever gave me this.

82
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,950
So here it's going to be advantageous to
use the,

83
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,240
the other notation, which will be in the
next line.

84
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:34,380
[COUGH]

85
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,520
And then I'm also going to take the
partial derivative.

86
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,060
With respect of f with respect to y,
that's

87
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,890
going to be a function of x and y again.

88
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:50,670
But then I have to evaluate that I'm sorry
multiply that by h prime of t.

89
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,780
So this is, this is the chain rule popping
out again, but I'm basically, what I'm

90
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,460
trying to do is capture how f is going to
react to a change in x.

91
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,570
And how f is going to react to a change in
y, and

92
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,450
then multiply that by how fast those are
changing with respect to t.

93
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,950
And when I add those together, that's
going to be

94
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,500
giving me my full derivative of F with
respect to t.

95
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,160
And this, is not something that you're
supposed to just look at

96
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,740
and understand, this is sort of the
definition of the chain rule.

97
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,830
When I define a function this way.

98
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,350
And so it's a little bit more clear when I
write

99
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,720
the, when I write out the chain rule using
this notation.

100
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,710
So I have df dt, so the full derivative of
f with respect to t, so I just take

101
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,980
the partial of f with respect to x and
multiply

102
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,240
that times the derivative of x with
respect to t.

103
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,020
And then I do the same thing with the

104
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,730
partial derivative of f with respect to y,
times the

105
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,360
partial, times the derivative of y with
respect to t.

106
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,340
And so the, the, here, f is a function of

107
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,730
two variables, so I have to think of doing
partial derivatives.

108
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,500
But here, x.

109
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,200
And y, these are just functions of the

110
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,680
single variable t, so I get full
derivatives there.

111
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,340
So we can do a quick example of this.
So suppose I let

112
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,860
f of xy equal x squared plus y plus xy
cubed,

113
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,580
and x is equal to e to the 2t, and y is
equal to t squared.

114
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,330
So first just to make sure that, you know,
I'm not selling snake oil I suppose, I'm

115
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:35,530
going to do this by direct computation.
So one way to make this into a function

116
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:41,010
of t alone is just to in the function
itself, replace x.

117
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,190
By e to the 2 t, and replace all the y's
by t squareds.

118
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,220
So if I do that, I get f of t is e to the
4t.

119
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,930
So that's just e to the 2t squared.

120
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,090
T squared, that's, came from my y.

121
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,440
And then y cubed this going to give me t
to the sixth

122
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,100
and the x is going to give me e to the 2t,
and

123
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,800
then I will take the derivative of this
with respect to t.

124
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,070
So, it's pretty easy.

125
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,430
I can do the first two just term by term
so.

126
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,550
Here I've cheated a little bit with the
chain rule

127
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,540
I skipped doing the substitution, but
that's 4e to the 4t.

128
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,470
T squared by the power rules just going to
be 2t.

129
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,650
And then here I have a function of t times
another function of

130
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,740
t so I have to use the product rule.

131
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,690
So that says derivative of the first
function so derivative of t to the

132
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:43,330
sixth and sixth t to the fifth times the
second function plus the first function

133
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,800
[COUGH]

134
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,680
times the derivative of the second
function.

135
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,650
And so that tells me that the derivative
of

136
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,412
f with respect to t is this expression
here.

137
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:58,320
Let's see, yeah, so, that's as simple as

138
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,570
it's going to get so it's not particularly
pretty.

139
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,890
But it's also ugly enough that if we get
the exactly the

140
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,770
same thing I'm not going to think that it
just happened by chance.

141
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,070
So, we'll try this again, this time using
the chain

142
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,690
rule So first I'm going to calculate all
the pieces I need.

143
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,500
So, I'll need the derivative of f with
respect to

144
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,320
x, the partial derivative of f with
respect to x.

145
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,450
So, that's pretty easy to see using
linearity and the power rule.

146
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,860
And the partial derivative of f with
respect to y.

147
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,962
And then I need the derivative of x with
respect to t, so that's 2e

148
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:42,510
to the 2t, and the derivative of y with
respect to t, so that's just 2t.

149
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,730
So remember x was equal to e to the 2t,
and y was equal to t squared.

150
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,810
And so now my expression for the
derivative.

151
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,630
With respect to t of f of xy was the
partial of f

152
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,430
with respect to x times the derivative of
x with respect to t.

153
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:05,370
Plus the derivative of f, sorry partial of
f with respect

154
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,490
to y times the derivative of y with
respect to t.

155
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,680
[COUGH]

156
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,000
So, I'll just go ahead and from the things
I've already calculated plug those in.

157
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,270
So, hopefully, it's clear where all of
that came

158
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,100
from, just each one of these shows up
here.

159
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,720
And, now, I need to get the answer in
terms of t so

160
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,660
I'll just substitute n, the expressions
for t for, for x and y.

161
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,390
Okay.

162
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,570
And then I just threw a little bit of
simplication,

163
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:57,640
and I think, so let's see, I put it in The
terms with, the polynomial bit descending.

164
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,730
So I have a t to the sixth term.
A t to the fifth term.

165
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,210
A t term, and a t to the zero term.

166
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,940
Just, that's how I'm going to put these in
order.

167
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,660
And so, was that.
Go back to the last thing.

168
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,670
So here I had t to the 6th term, 2e to the
2t,

169
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,750
t to the 5th term, t term, and t to the 0
term.

170
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,250
So,

171
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,730
so using the chain rule we got the same
result that we did using the direct

172
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,598
calculation.
Okay,

173
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:42,160
and so

174
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,260
now we'll let again, f of xy be a
differentiable function.

175
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,560
But now we're going to allow x to be a
function of

176
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,400
two other variables.

177
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,790
And y to be a function of two of them, the
same two other variables.

178
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,830
So we can express, we can write s, x as a
function

179
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,270
of s and t and y as a function of s and t.

180
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,510
And here, g and h, so these functions that
give me

181
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,499
x and t, x and y, also need to be
differentiable functions.

182
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:18,670
So, then if I re-write the function like
this, I can

183
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,030
think of my function f as a function of s
and t.

184
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,480
And I can write the derivatives.

185
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,380
So now because f of x is again, or f is
again a function of two variables.

186
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,920
I've just changed variables from x and y
to s and t.

187
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,970
I'm going to end up with two partials for
f, for f.

188
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,980
So have partial f, partial s.

189
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,640
And there I'm just going to get that

190
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,450
by both of these are equivalent, just
depending on

191
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,160
whether you want to think of the name of
the function that gives you x as x or

192
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,000
if you want to consider it g.
But essentially, I just have to add up.

193
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,310
The, the partials that give me my partial
with respect to S.

194
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:07,120
So I take the partial of f with respect
with s, times, the partial of, sorry,

195
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,070
partial of f with respect to x times the
partial of f with respect to s.

196
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,510
And I'm going to add that to partial to f
with respect to y times the partial

197
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,220
of y with respect to s.

198
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,760
And that sort of captures, all of the

199
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,500
dependents of my function f, on the
variable f.

200
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,890
And then I can do exactly the same thing
for the variable t.

201
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,390
[SOUND]

202
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,510
And so in general If f is a function of n
variables.

203
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:50,830
And for each i and 1 to n, x i.
So all I'm saying here is

204
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:56,559
each one of those variables, is in turn a
function of m other variables.

205
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,280
Then the partial derivative of f with
respect to tj so t

206
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,650
is one of my, sort of, second level
variables, is

207
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,500
given by this formula.
So it just says the partial of f with

208
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:18,730
respect to tj is equal to the sum Of the
partial of f with respect to

209
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:24,840
each argument of f times the partial of
the argument with respect to t j

210
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,320
so really what i am trying to do is just

211
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,600
capture all of the dependence of f on this
t

212
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,400
j and add those together and that's
going to give me

213
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,340
the partail of f with respect to t sub j.

214
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,810
And I worked through a very complicated
example of this as well.

215
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,560
I think.

216
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,100
So I'll just let you look at how I'm
setting it up.

217
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,210
So I have f is now a function of three
variables.

218
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:00,250
Given by this, again not very pretty
expression, and then each one of the

219
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:06,340
arguments of f, so x1, x2, x3 is in turn a
function of two variables.

220
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,450
So that means even though when I want to
write down F.

221
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,730
I see three things here.

222
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,320
There's really only kind of two degrees of
freedom, there's,

223
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,640
there's t1 and t2 that are affecting how f
changes.

224
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,710
And to calculate the partial, I'm just
going to take the partial of f, with

225
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:31,320
respect to the first argument, times the
partial of that wirh respect to t1.

226
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,180
Add that to the same thing for the second
argument..

227
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,460
And add that to the same thing for the
third argument.

228
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,790
I think I actually did all of this, but
I'm.

229
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,690
It's just algebra, so you have it all on

230
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,290
the slide if you would like to go through
it.

231
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,240
It comes from

232
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,170
the textbook too, so I think the reason I
chose to

233
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,340
do this was just I was reading the book
and thought,

234
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,150
that's way too complicated To go sort of
directly from here

235
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,360
to here, so, now you have an explanation,
if you need it.
