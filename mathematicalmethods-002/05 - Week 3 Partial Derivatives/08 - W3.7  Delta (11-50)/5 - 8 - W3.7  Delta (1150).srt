1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,070
Now we get to the, the fun part which is
actually taking derivitaives.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,420
So we'll start off by calculating delta.

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:15,550
So the delta of a European call option is
the rate of change, oops.

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,330
Of c of s t, so again remember this is the
actual Black-Scholes pricing formula.

5
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,850
So, even though I've written it here as c
of s

6
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,350
comma t it's really a function of all of
the seven variables

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,900
that I had on the, the first set of
slides.

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,610
And I'm going to take that, it says the
rate

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,130
of change with respect to the asset price
s.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,270
So, how how much does the value of the
call option change?

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,760
As the price of the underlying asset
changes.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,080
And so mathematically I can write that
just as, delta is equal to the partial

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,484
derivative with respect to s of the

14
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:56,560
Black-Scholes pricing formula for a
European call option.

15
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,980
And so this is the pricing formula for a
European

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,210
call option that I had in the first set of
slides.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,560
And, I'm just going to go ahead and start
using the rules we've

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,360
been developing er, earlier in this course
to start taking the dcerivative here.

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,799
So the first thing I'll, I'll notice.

20
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:24,320
Is that the pricing formula has two terms.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,740
So I can use the linearity property of the
derivative to

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,030
write this as the, so this is a, a sum
essentially.

23
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,780
And so the derivative of a sum is the sum
of the derivatives.

24
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,570
And then I'm also in, in this one step
going to combine the.

25
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,900
Scaling properties, so when I'm taking the
derivative with respect to s.

26
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,140
So, I am taking a partial derivative with
respect to s.

27
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,250
Anything that isn't a function of s, I can
treat as

28
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,218
a constant, and any constant I can move
across the derivative operator.

29
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:06,480
So, in the first case here.
This part the e to the minus qt minus t.

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,660
That doesn't depend on s so I'm going to
take

31
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,180
that out and I end up with e to the minus

32
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,140
qt minus t times the partial derivative
with respect to

33
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,699
s of the product s times capital phi of d
plus.

34
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,590
And on, on the right hand side I'm
going to do the same thing, except here

35
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,480
I have two parts that don't depend on s,

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,860
so I can take those across the derivative
operator.

37
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,760
If I have minus ke to the r.

38
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,120
Sorry.

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,190
Minus ke to the minus rt minus t, times
the

40
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,620
partial derivative with respect to s of
phi of d minus.

41
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,940
And so, the next step here is both phi of
d plus.

42
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,180
D plus depends on all of the arguments

43
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,310
of the Black Scholes pricing formula
including s.

44
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,380
And so does d minus.

45
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,680
So, this is, I'm going to look at it

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,040
and say, that's the product of two
functions of s.

47
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,440
That's s, which is a very simple function
of s.

48
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,450
And phi of capitol d plus.

49
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,510
So I'll have to use the product rule on
the first term.

50
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,030
And so the product rule says if I have the
product of two

51
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,270
functions, I take the derivative of the
first function times the second function.

52
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,800
So that gives me just a capital phi of d
plus Plus the first function, s.

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,240
So this s comes from right here.

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,560
Times the derivative of the second
function.

55
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,289
So times the derivative with respect to s
of capital phi of d plus.

56
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,070
So now I have a pretty complicated formula
so what

57
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,950
I'm going to do is kind of attack pieces
of it

58
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,660
and then we'll be able to put all of those

59
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,110
together to get an expression for delta in
the end.

60
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,761
So the first thing I'm going to look at.

61
00:03:56,761 --> 00:04:02,250
Are we have these partial derivatives with
respect to s of phi of, and

62
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,920
so I've used this plus, minus sign

63
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,720
here just because the functions are very
similar.

64
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,170
So quite often when

65
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,740
I take derivatives of that I'm going to
get the same answer.

66
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
if not, I'll put a plus, minus.

67
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,290
And where it's important, and then if I'm
just talking

68
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,480
about d plus, you'd think of this as a
plus.

69
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,450
If I'm talking about d minus, you think
about this as a minus.

70
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,970
So the chain rule says that if I want to
take the derivative of capital phi of d

71
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,310
plus with respect to s, that's going to be

72
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,080
equal to the derivative with respect to
its argument.

73
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,720
So with respect to this d plus or minus,
of fee of d plus or minus,

74
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,350
times the partial derivative of d with
respect to s.

75
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,420
And

76
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,250
now remember the definition of capital
fee.

77
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,010
As just we were integrating from minus
infinity up to

78
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,360
d of this function, lower case phi of x,
dx,

79
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,770
and so, I, I like to use the shorthand

80
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,930
notation little phi of x for this function
here.

81
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,880
Just it saves me writing some stuff.

82
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,270
Also, it's less likely that I'm going to
make a

83
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,810
mistake if I just have to write that down
rather than.

84
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,620
This whole expression.

85
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,810
And we saw in the, in the second week how

86
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,280
I could take the derivative of, of
something like that.

87
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,790
So it's just the derivative of an
indefinite integral.

88
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,170
And so, again, I'm just, I'm doing the
same calculation two times.

89
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,540
So it's either, I'm treating it as phi of
x.

90
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,070
Or I'm treating it as.

91
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,000
The actual expression for that function,
and

92
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,280
then when I evaluate these it turns out

93
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,900
that the derivative is either, is just
lower

94
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,480
case phi of either d plus or d minus.

95
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,550
And then it has this functional form on
the right hand side here.

96
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,230
So that gets me this part the derivative.

97
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,670
The partial derivative of capital phi with
respect to s.

98
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,430
So, what I have so far, I have this
expression for delta,

99
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,090
and then we just evaluated this thing here
and this thing here.

100
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,020
So I have this expression for the
derivative of capital fee,

101
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,800
and I still need this part here so the
derivative of,

102
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,340
the partial derivative of d plus or minus
with respect to s.

103
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:43,840
So

104
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,020
I have the first term here, is this guy.

105
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,106
And now to get the full derivative I still
need to evaluate the

106
00:06:57,106 --> 00:07:00,030
derivative of phi plus, that kind of came
out by the chain rule.

107
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,590
So, I'll move one step ahead with our
formula.

108
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,900
So I'm going to substitute this result
here.

109
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,520
Oops.

110
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,780
This result in the second line, into the

111
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,400
first line, to update my expression for
delta.

112
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,800
But I still have this partial of d plus
with respect

113
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,410
to s, and partial of d minus with respect
to s.

114
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,620
So that's what I'm going to do in the next
slide.

115
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,580
So I need to compute the partial
derivatives

116
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,010
of d plus and d minus.

117
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,510
So remember from the, from the first set
of slides

118
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,010
I said, I gave definitions for what d plus
and

119
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,840
minus look like and so now I can write
them

120
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,270
as, just one, formula, using this plus
minus notation, so.

121
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,870
The only difference between d plus and d
minus was this plus

122
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,240
or minus sign here, so I've just replaced
it with this little placeholder.

123
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,080
And now I want to take the derivative of
this with respect to s.

124
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,560
And so I'm going to make a little
simplification here, so If I have a sum in

125
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,860
the numerator, I can write this as log of
s over k divided by

126
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,589
sigma times the square root of t minus t,
so that'll be one fraction, and then plus.

127
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,560
R minus q plus or minus sigma squared over
2 times

128
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,860
t minus t divided by sigma, square root of
t minus t.

129
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,060
So that's a second fraction, I'm just
adding those two fractions together.

130
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,750
And so the reason I'm going to want to do
that is because after, this

131
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,070
s here only appears in the, in the first
one of those fractions.

132
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,030
So what I'm going to end up with is.

133
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:48,330
I'll want to take the partial derivative
of the leftover part with respect to s but

134
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,500
there is no s's in this part so I can
treat that as a constant.

135
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,680
So this term in the right hand side that's
just

136
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,500
going to go away that will be equal to
zero.

137
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,400
And then I'm left with 1 over sigma times
the square root of t minus

138
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,610
t, times the partial derivative with
respect to s of the log of s over k.

139
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,880
So I'll do a little substitution here.
So I'll let u equal s over k.

140
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,050
Then I can rewrite this Here, as the
partial

141
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,500
derivative of, with respect to s, of log
of u.

142
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,010
And so by the chain rule, that's going to
be the derivative

143
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,900
of the log times the derivative of u with
respect to s.

144
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,290
So, the derivative of log of u is just 1
over u.

145
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,610
And then I have this partial u, partial s.

146
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,620
And I'm going to calculate that just by
taking the

147
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,800
partial derivative with respect to s of u
here.

148
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,780
So, that's going to be 1 over k.

149
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,700
So what I'm left with is 1 over sigma,
square root of t minus t.

150
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,440
K over s.

151
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,980
So, u was s over k.

152
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,800
If I take one over that, I get k over s.

153
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,790
And then times 1 over k, which is just
this partial derivative, partial

154
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,300
u, partial s, which I, which popped out
because of the chain rule.

155
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,760
So, we'll see that the k's are going to
cancel here.

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,360
And I end up with partial derivative with
respect to s of either d plus or d

157
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,070
minus is just 1 over s times sigma times
the square root of t minus t.

158
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,819
So in this case I was able to get both of
those calculations.

159
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,070
Because the, the plus or minus bit didn't
depend on

160
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,360
s, so that ended up being zero, so it
wouldn't

161
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,780
matter if I was taking the derivative of d
plus

162
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,740
or d minus, I'm going to get the same
expression here.

163
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:53,660
So, putting everything together, all I'm ,
all I need to do now is, I have this.

164
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,960
This is my most up to date expression for
delta, but it still

165
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,080
has this partial derivative of d plus and
d minus with respect to s.

166
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,720
But that's exactly what we calculated on
the previous slide here, so I just

167
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,020
have to put a 1 over S sigma squared to t
minus t into here.

168
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,400
Oops, I guess I had it on the next line.

169
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,640
And so, that's going to give the following
expression for delta.

170
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,140
So,

171
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:26,090
I'm going to get e to the minus q, t minus
t, times capital phi of d plus.

172
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,760
And I have the rest of this in light gray,
because

173
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,320
if you look in the text book, this is the
entire.

174
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,620
Oops, maybe I got it backwards.
Nope.

175
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,070
just the part in the dark black is the
entire expression for delta.

176
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,890
But we still have these other terms left
over.

177
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,130
And so in the next set of slides

178
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,770
I'm going to go through an argument about
why that's going to be equal to zero.
