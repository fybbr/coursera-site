1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:06,260
Okay and last section for today is on
implicit functions.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,210
So, so far we've been expressing functions
of

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,990
one variable in terms, so.
Functions.

4
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,750
What did I write here?

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,860
Functions have expressed one variable in
terms of another.

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,730
Or, or, several, like we just started
today.

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,610
So, we had something like y is equal to f
of x, which is equal to.

8
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,790
1 minus x squared.

9
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,530
So this is sort of the, the nicest way of,
of presenting a function.

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,390
It's like, you give

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,472
me a value of x, I know exactly how to
tell you the corresponding value of y.

12
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:50,940
So I have this, so I have something like y
equals sine x divided by x.

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,130
So I have, oops, I have y on the left side
of the,

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,960
of the equation and only x's on the right
side of the equation.

15
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,120
So, an implicit function is defined by

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,400
a more general relationship between the
variables.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,560
So I could say something, so this is the
equation of a circle.

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,140
So I say, x squared plus y squared equals
1.

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,490
And this is if I'm on a circle of radius
one.

20
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,060
This is going to be true for every point
that's on that circle,

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,820
and it's going to be false for every point
that's not on that circle.

22
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,940
And this one, if you, if you think about

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,880
what I've done up here, it at least has
kind

24
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,790
of an easy way to go between the old

25
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,450
or the, the, you know, specific,
definition of a function.

26
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,010
So this is, you know, in high school, I

27
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,780
had to do something called the vertical
line test.

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,960
So, if I have a function, and I find the
intersection

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,790
of that function with any vertical line,
it can have at

30
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,550
most one point where they cross.

31
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,510
If it, if it's like a circle, and it
crosses twice, then it's not a function.

32
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,370
So, for a given x, there has to be a
unique value y.

33
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,130
The circle's not going to have that
property

34
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,140
except for two points one at either end.

35
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,740
But it's not that bad either, it's very
easy to fix.

36
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,480
I can just chop it into a top circle and a
bottom circle.

37
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,860
this one we're going to see is not quite
so well behaved.

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,740
So in some cases, you can just solve for
one function as another in any, any one

39
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:33,740
of these functions, any function I can
write f of x equals, some expression of x.

40
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,790
I could just move all of that to one side

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,580
of the equals sign and say it's an
implicit function.

42
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:48,150
and the way we're actually going to define
this is I'm going to say that, f of xyz

43
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,950
is a function of three variables, and the
set of points that satisfy f of xyz.

44
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,340
So I just choose x, y and z, it could be
just x and y.

45
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,395
Or it could be many, many more variables
this is just kind of an example with

46
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:07,450
three.
So, in this case, the implicit

47
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,200
function is going to be the set of points
that satisfy f of

48
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,130
xyz equals 0.
And in that case, I'm going to call that

49
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,630
set of points where this condition holds.
The locus defined by f.

50
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,630
So it sort of like I mentioned before if I
have the

51
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,330
equation of a circle, a x squared plus y
squared equals 1.

52
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,560
If I on this circle, then this statement
is going to be true.

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,880
So any point on this circle of radius one.

54
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,870
Is going to satisfy this equation exactly.

55
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,740
If I'm inside the circle x squared plus y
squared going to be less than 1.

56
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,540
And if I'm outside the circle it's going
to be greater than 1.

57
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,080
And I have this one set of points that
satisfies this.

58
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,710
And so that's going to be my locus.

59
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,778
It's got infinitely many points in it.

60
00:04:01,778 --> 00:04:04,920
because this is, it's a line, it's
continuous.

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,800
For any two points on the circle, I can

62
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,120
find in between them that's also on the
circle.

63
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,160
But, in this case, I can fix it pretty
easily.

64
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,760
So I can say y equals 1 minus x, square
root of 1 minus x squared.

65
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,280
That gives me the blue curve which is the

66
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,810
top semi circle and then I can say minus
square

67
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,560
root of 1 minus x squared, and that gives
me

68
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,740
the red curve, which is the bottom of the
semicircle.

69
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,969
This one on the other hand has a locus
that looks like this.

70
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,830
And so this is more difficult.

71
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,190
you know, maybe there's some hope that on
the left side of the y axis, so

72
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,500
over here you can solve for, you know,

73
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,620
at least here it passes the vertical line
test.

74
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,750
So, maybe you could solve this and get an
expression y equals something.

75
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,310
Well not maybe you can, but it's not very
much fun.

76
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,660
on the right side, until you get to this
point over here

77
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,440
where this little loop ends, it doesn't
pass the vertical line test.

78
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,840
So here for instance, a vertical line
would intersect the function three times.

79
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,800
But we might still want to be able to take
a derivative of either of these functions.

80
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,490
So suppose I want to find the slope of a

81
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,490
tangent line to the unit circle, so, that
circle I

82
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,480
just had a picture of that has radius one,
that's

83
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,480
called the unit circle, because the radius
is one unit.

84
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:39,720
So I have to split this up, if I want to
do this using Regular functions.

85
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,450
I have to split this up into two cases.

86
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,130
I have to consider the top semicircle and
the bottom semicircle independently.

87
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,090
But I can use the chain rule to sort of
help me out here.

88
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,270
So what I'm going to do is take the
derivative.

89
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,220
I have y equals.
The square root of 1 minus x squared.

90
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,530
And I'll take the derivative of both sides
of that equation with respect to x.

91
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,770
And by the chain rule, when I'm taking the
derivative

92
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,310
of y with respect to x, I have to
multiply.

93
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,650
So I'm going to take the derivative of y.
But that's just going to be

94
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,590
1, so there's kind of an invisible one

95
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,380
over here that I didn't bother to write
down.

96
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,970
Times the derivative of y with respect to
x

97
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,920
and remember this is what I'm trying to
find.

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:29,490
This is the, the derivative and on the
right hand side I'm now going to take the

99
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,080
derivative with respect to x and this
should be

100
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,710
pretty easy because it's just a function
of x.

101
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,770
So I'll rewrite the square root as
quantity to the one

102
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,060
half power, so it's easier to use the
power rule.

103
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,390
And then, cheat a little bit with the
chain rule again.

104
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,710
So here, the derivative of the inside of
this quantity.

105
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,910
The derivative of one is zero because it's
a constant.

106
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,140
The derivative of minus x squared is going
to be minus 2 x.

107
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:00,460
So the chain rule pops that minus 2x out
here

108
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,850
and if I simplify so the two is going to
cancel

109
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,890
out the one half that popped out here
because of the power rule.

110
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,550
So I end up with minus x divided by this
square root of 1 minus x squared.

111
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,230
And then case two is going to be very
similar

112
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,210
except there's going to be a minus sign
here.

113
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,910
So I'll just skip down to the bottom.

114
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,080
And we get exactly the same thing except
now I have the minus sign down here.

115
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,240
And when I don't bother cancelling out a
minus

116
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,720
sign, it's because I have something clever
for you coming in the future.

117
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,320
So just keep this bit in mind.

118
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,590
That this is minus x divided by the square
root of 1 minus x squared.

119
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,770
And this is minus x, divided by minus the
square root of 1 minus x squared.

120
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,270
[COUGH]

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,500
And

122
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:57,280
so, now I'm going to try doing this using
the idea of an implicit function.

123
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,550
So.

124
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,740
If I take the, derivative of a function of
y squared, by the chain rule, I can take

125
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,640
the derivative of this with respect to y
and then multiply by dy, dy.

126
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,210
So, this is the same thing I did on

127
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,340
the previous slide, except now, I have a y
squared

128
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,510
here instead of a y.
So, it doesn't just go away.

129
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,260
So instead of having my invisible one, I
end up

130
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,480
with the derivative of this, 2 y times dy
dx.

131
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,330
let's see what I'm going to get down here.
Oh, okay.

132
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,690
So this is my little result.

133
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,360
And now I'm going to try and take the
derivative of.

134
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,520
The equation of a circle.

135
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,780
The implicit equation of a circle, with
respect to x.

136
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,460
So, I still have the linearity property.
So here I want to do

137
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:53,180
the derivative of a sum, so that's just
going to be

138
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,940
the sum of the derivatives.

139
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,220
And on the right hand side I'm just
going to take the derivative

140
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,638
of one, one is a constant so hopefully we
get zero for there.

141
00:09:01,638 --> 00:09:02,998
And we do.

142
00:09:02,998 --> 00:09:06,780
And when I split this sum up into two
terms I

143
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,700
end up with the derivative with respect to
x of x squared

144
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,790
so that's going to be easy to do because I
have, I've

145
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,650
got my function already in the right
units, in the right variable.

146
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,200
And then when I

147
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,990
want to take the derivative of y squared
with res-, with respect to x, that's when

148
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,310
I'm going to have to, oops, use this
result that I, I went through up here.

149
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,766
So I'm going just end up with 2y, dy dx.

150
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,480
So I end up with this expression here, 2x
plus 2y, times dy dx.

151
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,080
But remember I'm trying to find the

152
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,230
derivative for this tangent line touching
the circle.

153
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,980
And d y d x is going to be the slope of
that tangent line.

154
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,790
So d y d x is what I'm trying to get.

155
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,900
So I'm just going to solve for d y d x
now.

156
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,890
So I subtract 2 x from both sides, and
then divide by 2 y.

157
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,020
So I end up with minus x over y.

158
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,480
And now remember when I did my two cases,
I had

159
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,660
to have the top half of the circle, that
was y

160
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,310
equals the square root of 1 minus x, and
so when

161
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,750
y is greater then zero, this is what I
would get.

162
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,000
And when y is less than zero I get the,
the bottom half.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,880
But in both

164
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,780
cases, oops I guess I can't highlight just
the denominator here, in both cases the

165
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:31,430
denominator is just the value of y
appropriate for where I am on the circle.

166
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:37,490
So if I don't insist on getting rid of Y
entirely I can actually

167
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:43,330
express both of these as this one formula,
dy, dx equals minus x divided by y.

168
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,990
And so that the only caveat,

169
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,200
the, so the thing you have to be careful
of, is that this is

170
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,840
only going to hold four points in the
locus So, you know, I can still

171
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,010
evaluate this at the point 1,1 and get
negative one but that has no

172
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,300
interpretation for what I've done because
the point 1,1 is not on the circle.

173
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,150
Okay, and then just for fun I did this, so
this.

174
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,590
Funny shaped thing with the, the loop in
it is called a Folium which I

175
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,470
guess is Latin for leaf and somebody
thought

176
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,990
that that little loop looked like a leaf.

177
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,640
So here it's going to be a little bit
trickier, but we're still going to

178
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,030
use all of the properties exactly the way
that we had been doing it.

179
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,820
So I'm just going to take the derivative
of

180
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,470
both sides Of this equation with respect
to x.

181
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,350
Since here I have a project.
So it's x times y.

182
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,720
I'm going to have to, woops.

183
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:44,120
Yeah.
So I need to treat x and y.

184
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,100
So I'm kind of imagining y is a function
of x.

185
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,270
Even though I can't actually write it down
that way.

186
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,820
So what I did here I on the left hand side
I just use linearity

187
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,700
to write the sum as a derivative of a sum
as the sum of the derivative

188
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,900
and on the right hand side I had to use
the product rule so I used 6x times y.

189
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,600
And so I get the derivative of the first
function with respect

190
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,770
to x is 6 times y, so that's where this
came from.

191
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,210
And then I'm also going to take the
derivative of the second function,

192
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:29,620
which is y, so I'm going to take
derivative with respect to x.

193
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,580
Of y times the first function which is 6
x.

194
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,710
So that's where this sec, second term
comes from.

195
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,740
It's just the product rule.

196
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,820
But the derivative of y with respect to x,
so that's, that's what I'm looking for.

197
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,020
Again, that's d y d x.

198
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,960
So technically it's The chain rule, so I
take the derivative of y with respect

199
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,700
to y times dy dx, but really, you can just
think of this as going straight to dy dx.

200
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:07,570
But now I've got this dy dx on both sides.
But I'm just going to use algebra to

201
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,720
move both of those terms to one side of

202
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,820
the equation, and everything else to the
other side.

203
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,040
So I'm going to end up with, so here I had
a positive 3y squared.

204
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,060
That's where this came from.

205
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,440
And then I had a 6x on this side, but when

206
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,620
I move it to the other side it'll become
minus 6x.

207
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,080
So I have 3y squared minus 6x times dy dx,
and then everything

208
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,610
else, so 6y minus 3x squared on the right
hand side.

209
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:40,690
And, then, I'm just going to divide both
sides by 3y square minus 6x and

210
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,930
that gives me an expression for my
derivative.

211
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:50,440
And, again, so I think, okay, let's see,
2y minus x so, you have to be a little bit

212
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,170
careful with this again because, again,
it's only going to be defined when I'm On

213
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,160
the curve, so if I take any other point,
I'll still be able to evaluate this, and

214
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,810
it will give me a number, but that

215
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,570
number has no interpretation for what I've
just done.

216
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:10,540
This only gives me the derivative for
points that are on this curve.

217
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:16,700
And then there's still some, one small
problem so if you look at

218
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,470
Where the curves cross I actually should
have two derivatives somehow here.

219
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,540
I have one flat derivative and one
infinitely steep

220
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,720
derivative and so the way you're going to,
capture that

221
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,780
is that's at the origin so that's at x
equals zero, y equals zero.

222
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,850
And if x and y are equal to 0, then this
is zero and this is zero.

223
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,410
So I get one of these numbers that do not
exist.

224
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,910
And so,

225
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:51,110
in that case you just have to examine the
function

226
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,220
and try and figure out what its behavior
is here.

227
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,240
But since it's crossing the derivative
it's

228
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,490
not going to be differential at that
point.

229
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,050
Is that the whole idea doesn't really make
any sense.

230
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,440
So it's, you know, I couldn't say

231
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,890
you know, if I wanted to add h to this.

232
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,720
You know, would it be h going up this way
or would it be h going out that way?

233
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,660
I, I can't do that with just one h so
you'd have to

234
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,138
do something more complicated if you
wanted to extend the idea of a derivative.

235
00:15:19,138 --> 00:15:21,250
To this one point where the curves cross.
