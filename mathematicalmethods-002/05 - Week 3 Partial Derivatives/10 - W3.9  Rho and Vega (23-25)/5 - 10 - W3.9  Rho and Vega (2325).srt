1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,550
Okay, so I want to keep moving along a
bit.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,450
So, Rho and Vega, they're a little bit
easier

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,590
so I tried to cram them into one lesson.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,150
So rho is the rate of change of the value

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,630
of a portfolio with respect to the
risk-free interest rate r.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,120
And so again r portfolio that we are
considering right now

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,560
just has a single asset in it which is
called option.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,040
So, this will be the pricing formula for
my portfolio, and I want to take the

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,420
derivative of that with respect to r, the

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,204
partial derivative with respect to the
risk-free interest rate.

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:50,200
[SOUND]

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,430
So, what's going to happen, here, the

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,900
first, the first term will be relatively
easy.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,980
So I'm going to use the, again the
linearity property, so

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,660
derivative of a sum, is the sum of the
derivatives.

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,690
This Se to the minus q to the minus T
minus t, this doesn't depend on r.

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,060
So I can move that across the derivative
operator.

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,950
So the derivative of the first term is
going to be S q T minus t.

19
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,778
Se to the q minus q T minus t, times the
partial derivative with respect to r.

20
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:28,670
Of capital phi of d plus.

21
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,320
And then I need to subtract.
And

22
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,360
now, here, I'm going to take the product
rule.

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,010
Because ke to the minus r, t minus t, and
phi of d minus.

24
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,030
Those are two functions that both depend
on r.

25
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,470
So by the product rule, it's going to be
the derivative of the first function

26
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,100
times the second function, plus the
derivative

27
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,310
of the second function times the first
function.

28
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,780
So the derivative of the first

29
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:07,168
function with respect to R is going to be.

30
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:12,450
K times minus t minus little t.

31
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,080
So this is going to get a bit complicated.

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,010
I probably should have used a, a
substitution to get this.

33
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,760
But this minus sign here came from this
minus sign here.

34
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,780
Then when I take the derivative.

35
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,540
oh, did I make a mistake?
So when

36
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,320
[LAUGH]

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,150
when I take the derivative of

38
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:44,150
K e to the minus r T minus t, so r is the
variable I'm taking the derivative

39
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,643
with respect to, and that's multiplied by
minus capital T minus little t.

40
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:55,332
Yeah, do I have

41
00:02:55,332 --> 00:03:00,194
the minus?

42
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:05,680
I switched

43
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,790
the order of the terms.
So it is, okay, it is okay.

44
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,230
Right, okay.

45
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,060
Right?
Well, there's going to be two minus signs.

46
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,670
Because I'm take.

47
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,230
So this is, the mistake is that, when

48
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,720
you take the derivative with respect to
little t.

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,150
Little t is minus n here, and the r.
So,

50
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,500
minus.
Oh, sorry.

51
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,394
I'm confusing myself.
>>

52
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:27,402
[LAUGH].

53
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,210
>> I'm taking the derivative with
respect to r.

54
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,170
I got ahead of myself.

55
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:30,930
I was.

56
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,970
Working very hard right before class on
the theta, which is the

57
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,240
next lesson where I'll be taking a
derivative with respect to little t.

58
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,740
Yeah, so oh okay, this is correct.

59
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:46,080
So I have minus capital t minus little t
times k so that's why I get a minus

60
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,500
capital t times minus little t times k
times e to the minus r t minus t.

61
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,290
Times phi of d minus.

62
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,630
So it's a derivative of the first function
times

63
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,460
the second then plus the derivative of the
second function.

64
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,540
So I'm taking the partial derivative of
phi of

65
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,232
d minus and multiplying that by the first
function.

66
00:04:08,232 --> 00:04:14,620
K e to the minus r t minus t, mm okay.
So crisis avoided.

67
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,120
And

68
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:21,890
now by the chain rule, so I kept the.

69
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,020
So this, first Bit here it's going to stay
the same and now I'm trying

70
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,410
to take the derivative of a function of d
plus with respect to little r.

71
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,660
So I have to use the chain rule.

72
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,290
So I'm starting to do a few more steps in
each line here.

73
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,660
So we've already seen that the derivative
of capital phi of d

74
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,770
plus with respect to d plus, that's just
little phi of d plus.

75
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,650
And then by the chain rule, I need to
multiply that

76
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,000
by the partial derivative of D plus with
respect to R.

77
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,520
And then the same thing is going to happen
in

78
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,750
the second term of the part in the square

79
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,010
brackets here when I have to take the
derivative

80
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,860
of capital fee again with respect to D
minus.

81
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,000
So I'll get the derivative of capital phi
of d minus, is just lowercase

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,360
phi of d minus times the partial
derivative of d minus with respect to r.

83
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,430
So that's just the chain rule, so I've
used it here and

84
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,155
I've used it here.
>>

85
00:05:25,155 --> 00:05:25,655
[INAUDIBLE]

86
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,820
So that's the derivative of capital Phi so
remember we've defined capital

87
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,910
Phi as the integral from minus infinity up
to Z of little

88
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:45,530
phi.

89
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,990
Alright, so little phi is just the
derivative of Capital Phi essentially.

90
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,510
So, next thing I'm going to need are the
partial

91
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,840
derivatives of d plus and d minus with
respect to r.

92
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,780
So, again, this turns out not to be too
difficult because if I look at the

93
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,670
definition of d plus or d minus so I can,
again, look at these same time.

94
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:20,630
I can write this as, so I have log of S
over K divided by the denominator

95
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,460
minus q times T minus t over the
denominator, plus or

96
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,220
minus sigma squared over 2 times T minus t
over the denominator.

97
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,690
I want to take all of those bits that
don't depend on r.

98
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,410
And just lump them up into something
that's

99
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,410
constant, relative to the risk free
interest rate, r.

100
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,700
And then the only bit that's left over,
the part that's going

101
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:48,120
to depend on r, is going to be this plus r
divided

102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,420
by the square root of T minus t.

103
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:55,720
And so I have, I'll think of this T minus
t, the actual quantity.

104
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,740
As just the square root squared.

105
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,670
So one of those square roots is going to
cancel.

106
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:04,380
So I end up on the top with r times the
square root of T minus t.

107
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,740
And on the bottom, I just have this sigma
left over.

108
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,410
And now, this is actually a very easy
function to

109
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,270
take the derivative, because I'm, I
want to take the derivative

110
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,630
of this with respect to r, and so this is
just some number.

111
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,830
Times r to the first power, so I can use
the power rule to say

112
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,340
that's just going to be the square root of
t minus t divided by sigma.

113
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,800
And again, because it doesn't have the,
the part with this plus

114
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,540
or minus sigma squared ended up being
constant with respect to r.

115
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,590
That's just gone.

116
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,340
I doesn't matter if I'm taking the
derivative of d plus or d minus.

117
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,110
I'm going to get the same value, square
root of t minus t divided by sigma.

118
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,820
So if I substitute that in for d plus

119
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,660
and d minus, I end of with this expression
here.

120
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,470
So the first term that we, we already had
and then this

121
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,270
is just the, what we had on the, the slide
before, except the

122
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,140
partial derivative with respect to r of d
plus or d minus, that's

123
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,840
just been replaced with the square root t
minus t divided by sigma.

124
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,600
And I'm going to rewrite that like this.

125
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,270
So it might take a little bit of thinking
to

126
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,660
get from, from the top point to the bottom
point.

127
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,860
The first term stayed the same.

128
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:34,960
And all I did was reintroduce the square
root of T minus t in the denominator.

129
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,290
So I recovered, just a.

130
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,120
Square root of T minus t squared in the
numerator and

131
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,500
then I factored that out and that's where
this came from.

132
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,620
Then, because I've introduced this s in
the denominator here,

133
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,090
I can factor out an s over here as well.

134
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,250
And so may be with the, may be with the
little bit

135
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,450
of staring at this you will convince
yourself that I can move from

136
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:10,240
this line here to this line here and now
if you look

137
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,450
at the part that's in this square brackets
that's exactly the same expression.

138
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,000
That we showed was zero

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,420
[NOISE]

140
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,850
when we were trying to simplify the
expression for delta, so that I

141
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,090
could compute gamma without have to take
the derivative of all three terms.

142
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,420
So if this thing in the square brackets is
equal to zero,

143
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,460
then it doesn't matter what s, and capital
T and little t are.

144
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,040
This whole second line here is equal to
zero.

145
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,030
And so my expression for rho is just
going to

146
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,550
be K, oops, going to do it backwards, so K
times

147
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:47,870
T minus t times e to the minus r to the,
so e to the minus r T minus t

148
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:53,714
times capital phi of d minus.
So that's us getting rho.

149
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:53,714
[SOUND]

150
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:59,908
Vega is the rate of change of

151
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:05,831
the value of the portfolio

152
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:10,140
with respect to the volatility sigma.

153
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,520
So, now, I just need to take partial
derivatives with respect to sigma.

154
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,920
So again we're going to start off with
Black-Scholes formula for the price

155
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,370
of a European call option.
And

156
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,430
I want to take the derivative with respect
to sigma.

157
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,230
So that's my, my definition of vega.

158
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,770
And so this one looks like it should be
fairly straightforward since.

159
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,490
Here, s, e, q, t and t, there's no sigma
there and the

160
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:47,590
same for, for the right 10 term.
I have k, r, t and t.

161
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,300
So I'm just going to have to, you know, by
the linearity

162
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,150
property this is the derivative of a sum.
This is sum of the derivatives.

163
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,610
And I can move these terms that are

164
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,030
constant with respect to sigma across the
derivative operator.

165
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,330
So I can write this in this form here.

166
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,690
So I have vega equals S e to the minus q T
minus t.

167
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,520
And then I'm, I'm starting to do more
operations in each step, so.

168
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,230
By the chain role the derivative with

169
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,290
respect to sigma of capital phi is
going to

170
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,400
be the derivative of capital phi which
we've,

171
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,550
which I've said now is lower case phi.

172
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,320
So once you've sort of proved something
one

173
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,900
time, or once you've used a result often
enough.

174
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,870
We don't have to keep proving

175
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,490
at every single time that you do it,

176
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,350
and then by the Chain rule because I am
taking the derivative of.

177
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,800
Capital fi of d plus, d plus is the
function of sigma.

178
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,150
So, I have to use the Chain rule, and

179
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,398
so to get the correct derivative I need to
multiply.

180
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:54,020
Lower case phi of d plus by the derivative
the

181
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,160
partial derivative of d plus with respect
to sigma and then

182
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,195
I am going to do exactly the same thing to
the

183
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:04,500
right-hand term except that it's just
going to be a lower-case

184
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,360
phi of d minus and then by the chain

185
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,232
rule partial derivative of d minus with
respect to sigma.

186
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:12,441
Oh.

187
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:21,180
>> So is the, 'cause I heard earlier
that that guy was,uh,

188
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,210
[INAUDIBLE]

189
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:26,222
sigma and we had the, you know, phi being
the, the

190
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:26,370
[INAUDIBLE]

191
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:31,385
so, is the actual formula then, in this
case, one of several different varieties.

192
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:31,640
>>Right.

193
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:38,742
So, v, v is They chose that letter for a
value so it's the value of a portfolio.

194
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:38,742
>>

195
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:39,242
[INAUDIBLE]

196
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,930
>> Well I said in the first slide, the
portfolio I want

197
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,660
to consider during this session is a
portfolio that contains one call option.

198
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:57,410
Okay, so so for this you know v as an
general for instance when

199
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,670
you are doing the homework i asked you to
calculate vega of a put option.

200
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,120
So then you would say you know v of p

201
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,630
that would be partial if p with respect to
sigma.

202
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,870
In general, V is just whatever your
portfolio is, so you

203
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,040
could put, you know, several shares of the
asset into it.

204
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,140
You could put, some options into it.

205
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:25,390
Yeah, so V is kind of the general idea and
then, because I'm only pricing a portfolio

206
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,480
with a call option, I've just gone to just
using the call option pricing formula.

207
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,710
Okay, did I explain all of this slide
already yes, I did okay.

208
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,490
So what I need now are partial derivatives
of

209
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,700
d plus and d minus with respective to
sigma.

210
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,200
So I

211
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,860
will start out just by writing down what d
plus minus is so again I am

212
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,460
using this sort of place holder so I can
do them both at the same time.

213
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,500
And so it turns out I can separate this
into

214
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,760
two things that are going to be easier to
work with.

215
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,420
So there is one term in the numerator
here.

216
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,370
The sigma squared over 2 times t minus t
that has a sigma squared in it.

217
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,730
So I'm going to put that all by itself on
the right-hand side.

218
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,320
And so, what I've ended up doing is,

219
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,300
taking the sigma squared over 2, divided
by sigma.

220
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,380
So that's just this sigma

221
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,920
here, divided by 2.
Then I have a T minus t in the numerator.

222
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,700
And a square root of T minus t in the
denominator.

223
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,490
So I have.

224
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,070
T minus T, and square root of T minus T
here.

225
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:44,560
And then I have to just take what's left,
and put that in the other term.

226
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,790
So I have a log of S over K plus R minus Q
times T minus T.

227
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,470
So.
That's just this part here.

228
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,780
Divided by the square root of T minus T.

229
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,370
And then I'm going to, because I'm setting
myself up to use the

230
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,830
power rule, I'm just going to write that
as sigma to the minus one.

231
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,260
Because I'm, you know, for me personally,
less

232
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,500
likely to make a mistake if I write it

233
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,750
this way than if I try and take

234
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,010
the derivative just with the sigma and the
denominator.

235
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,540
So now I'm going to go ahead and take the
partial derivative of d

236
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,360
plus and minus with respect to sigma.

237
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,170
And notice it's, it's going to kind of
carry through

238
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,650
this time, because now I have the plus or
minus.

239
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,760
And there's a sigma here, so when I take
the derivative

240
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,610
I'm still going to have this plus or minus
thing here, so.

241
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,650
It's now getting important that we be
careful with the plus or minus notation.

242
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,200
So it doesn't look like I really did

243
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,500
anything, but all that happened here is
that

244
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:50,000
in the first term, I took minus 1 times
this coefficient here, so it's minus 1.

245
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,060
Times this fraction, to the times sigma to
the negative 2.

246
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,510
So that's just the power rule for the
first term.

247
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,260
And then the second term is pretty easy.

248
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,680
That was just sigma to the 1, so by the
power rule, I just get 1

249
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,620
times this quantity here, times sigma to
the 0, or just the

250
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,980
quantity, just the coefficient that was
multiplying the sigma in the second term.

251
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,400
And so I'm going to try and unsimplify now
a little bit, to see if

252
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,310
that, that's going to help me because
it's,

253
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,500
none of this is looking particularly
pretty yet.

254
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,590
So, sometimes when you put it back
together

255
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,730
it will resemble something that you have
seen before.

256
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:39,280
So I'll try doing that.
So, I'm going to multiply the right

257
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,570
hand term, by Sigma squared over Sigma
squared, just so that I

258
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,710
can have the, the same denominator for
both terms.

259
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,300
And so that's going to make this Sigma
squared

260
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,060
over two, pop up in the numerator again.

261
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,270
And so now, my notation's getting a little
bit tricky but

262
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,990
this turns into a minus over plus, which
just means now

263
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,700
that if I'm talking about d plus, I refer
to the

264
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,550
minus one here, and d minus refers to the
plus one here.

265
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,960
But it's starting to look a little bit
more familiar again.

266
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,380
So the sign here is changed, and I've
picked up a sigma

267
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,050
squared in the denominator, but that's an
expression for the, the derivative

268
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,460
of d plus, or d minus, with respect to
sigma.

269
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:24,960
And

270
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,870
now I need to substitute that, into this
formula here, and.

271
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,110
Generally, when I'm working, I, I like
after every step for things to look like

272
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,380
they're getting simpler and this is,
clearly, going

273
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,458
to make it get a lot more complicated.

274
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:49,410
So, I, I put this, kind of, wisecrack in
here.

275
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,840
It looks like it's going to get worse
before it gets better.

276
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,950
and so, usually, you know, you can do
this.

277
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,030
And if you don't make any mistakes, you
will get the right answer.

278
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,300
But, when I see something that gets this
complicated, I start thinking

279
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,450
like, you know, may be there's a better
way to do this.

280
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:12,080
Or to at least You know, if it's, sort of,
a risk management technique.

281
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,920
You know, now all of the sudden investing
a little bit of

282
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,110
time to, maybe, not have to do this might
be a good idea.

283
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,160
So, let's see what I have down here.

284
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,940
So, let's look at this, this results been
handy already.

285
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,490
So, maybe, I can squeeze a little bit more
mileage out of this.

286
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:37,370
Okay, so, we're here, so I'm going to
rewrite this, so if I,

287
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:42,850
if I add the second term to both sides, I
just put the equals sign in between here.

288
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,530
And then, since sigma and the square root
of T

289
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,630
minus t are going to be on both sides, I
can, and.

290
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,110
They're both greater than zero.

291
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:57,300
I'll multiply both sides by that.
And then move this S from the denominator

292
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,720
of this side just into the numerator on
this side so the fractions will go away.

293
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,910
So I can simplify this expression a bit
and I have this.

294
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,250
And so, does that look like it's going to
be helpful?

295
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:13,750
Well,

296
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,270
I've got an Se to the minus q, T minus t
here.

297
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:26,080
And I've got a Ke to the minus r, T minus
t here.

298
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,480
So, so far, you know, things are looking
good.

299
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,830
And so this was my expression for Vega, so
this

300
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,863
is exactly what I had on the previous
slide here.

301
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:48,734
And if

302
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:54,870
you look at this a bit, I've got this D
plus term, here.

303
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,770
So, the derivative of D plus with respect
to sigma on here.

304
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,230
A derivative of D minus with respect to
sigma.

305
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,929
And so, it turns out I can rewrite this
like this because I have.

306
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,160
On the previous slide I have this equality
relationship here,

307
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,670
and so now this is starting to look quite
a bit

308
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,590
better, and now the next big step that I
can make.

309
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,370
Was that not clear?
I guess I, I didn't mention one thing.

310
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,780
So what I did to, to get that, I took

311
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,260
the derivative of this expression here
with respect to sigma.

312
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,370
And that turns out to be exactly what this
is.

313
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,120
And now I can replace one of these guys
with,

314
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,670
With the bit that I have here with the s.

315
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:00,260
And so if I can replace this thing with
the, the first bit here.

316
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,790
Then I can just factor that out.

317
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,070
And so, essentially, it's that same
computation that we've done.

318
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,470
You know?
It's, it's kind of complicated.

319
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:08,970
But just.

320
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:16,350
changing this d minus, this phi of d minus
into a phi of d plus, and

321
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,530
some other stuff, but since I've already
done

322
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,720
that calculation, I'm just going to reuse
that result.

323
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,970
Then I end up with the partial derivative
of d plus with respect

324
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,570
to sigma minus the partial derivative of d
minus with respect to sigma.

325
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,810
But that's same thing so I can, you know,
do this linearity property backwards.

326
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,020
If I, if I had,

327
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,050
d plus minus d minus, and I took the
partial derivative of

328
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,830
that quantity, with respect to sigma, I
would get exactly this thing here.

329
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,440
And now the, the trick is to remember that
d minus

330
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,510
is defined in terms of d plus by this
relatively simple expression.

331
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,870
So if I want to look at d plus minus d

332
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,819
minus, so the thing that I'm trying to
take the derivative of.

333
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,290
I have D plus minus the quantity D plus

334
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,770
minus sigma times the square root of T
minus t.

335
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,030
And so, that's D plus minus D plus.

336
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,420
So, the D plus goes away.

337
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,860
And then, I have minus negative square
root of T minus t.

338
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,480
So that's just going to be sigma times the
square root of t minus t.

339
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,360
And then I'll take the derivative with
respect to sigma of both sides of this.

340
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,620
And so this is actually pretty straight
forward, this is just the power rule now.

341
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,540
So the partial derivative of sigma times
the square root of t with minus t.

342
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,860
With respect to sigma, it's just going to
be the square root of t minus t.

343
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,520
So that's quite a lot less work than I was
looking at before.

344
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,340
So now I can plug this in here,

345
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,600
and I'm finished.
So that's my expression for vega, so.

346
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,930
This partial derivative here of d plus
minus d minus, with respect

347
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,370
to sigma, that was just the square root of
T minus t.

348
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,470
And so then I have this S, S, T minus t, T
minus t,

349
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:24,380
and the rest, e to the minus q T minus t
times phi of d plus.
