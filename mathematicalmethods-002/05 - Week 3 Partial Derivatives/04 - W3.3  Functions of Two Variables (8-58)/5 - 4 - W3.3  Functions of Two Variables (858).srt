1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,390
Okay, so, moving on.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:07,280
So now, I'll just go over a little bit of
this using a function of two variables.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,130
Just hopefully, that'll help see something
concrete.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,710
This is about as big as it can get while
it still makes sense on some slides.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,180
So a, a function of two variables, we can
think of it as.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,020
F of xy and then, oops, and then, then

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,980
the notation I, I introduced in the last
section.

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,970
I'll just say that's from r two.

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,570
So, xy would describe a point in the xy
plane.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,820
And then f of xy is going to assign

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,560
one particular value to each point in the
xy plane.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,220
And so, that,

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,200
that would be r.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,340
So, you could think of it as z maybe
equals f of xy.

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,510
The partial derivatives of f are also
going to be functions of x and y.

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,000
And so this is how we would define them so
the partial of f with respect to x.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,650
It's a function of x and y so that's why I
put this xy here.

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,250
And it's just going to be defined as the
limit.

19
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,270
So here when I'm taking the derivative
with respect to x, I'm just going

20
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,880
to add a bit to the x argument and then
subtract away the value at

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,240
my point, divide by h so that the distant
between the two points where

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,560
I have evaluated the function and then
take the limit as h goes to zero.

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,490
So that's exactly the same as the
definition of

24
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,220
the derivative, except that you just have
this extra y

25
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:39,900
hanging on here.

26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,970
And then we do exactly the same thing for
y.

27
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,960
So this time I'm just adding the
perturbation to y.

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,840
And so that's going to give me the partial
derivative with respect to y.

29
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,290
And then the gradient of f of xy.
So I could write that as d.

30
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,270
So d here is an operator.

31
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,590
So the difference between an operator and
a function

32
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,580
is the output of a function is a number.

33
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,440
Here the output is going to be a vector of
two functions.

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,130
So the output is actually a function of x
and y.

35
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,780
And so instead of calling d a function,
I'm going to call it an operator.

36
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,289
So the output of an operator is a
function.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,960
And then the Hessian is just going to be
made up of,

38
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,990
and yes, I actually did it right.

39
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,330
the four sort of mixed partials, although
the

40
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,590
ones on the diagonal are sort of hidden.

41
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,630
Are in disguise, because even though
they're a

42
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,530
mixed partial, they're the same thing
mixed with itself.

43
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,290
But they're also each going to be
functions of x and y.

44
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,610
And so now let's look at an example, so
suppose I define my function to be.

45
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,510
X square y cubed, and I just want to
compute both the gradient.

46
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:17,090
So df is going to be the gradient, and d
squared f is going to be hessian.

47
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,810
And then I want to evaluate em at the
point 1,2.

48
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,200
And so remember, well let's see if I.

49
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,310
So if I was going to try and find the
slope of a function just using

50
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,690
a function of one variable When I take

51
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,310
the derivative of my function, I get a
function.

52
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,760
So if I have a function of x, and I

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,460
take the derivative, I also have a
function of x.

54
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,650
So I'd have f prime of x.

55
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:46,340
And then, suppose I want to know what is
the slope of f of x when x is equal to 3?

56
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,343
I just evaluate the derivative at the
point x equals 3.

57
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,550
it's definitely

58
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,440
a mistake to evaluate the function at
three and

59
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,070
then take the derivative because you would
get zero.

60
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,930
And so for some reason everybody seems to
understand

61
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,150
that with a single a function of a single

62
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,600
variable, but then they go ahead and make
that

63
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,470
mistake very often when they start working
with multiple.

64
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,600
So, for instance When I ask, evaluate.

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,420
Ask you to evaluate it at the point 1,2.
They'll calculate the gradient correctly.

66
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,670
Evaluate that at the point 1,2.

67
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,850
And then try and take the derivative of
that again.

68
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,950
And the moral is, you have to take

69
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,500
all of the derivatives before you start
evaluating.

70
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,320
So.

71
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,910
Here I have just skipped, most of the
work, I think I just put the answers here.

72
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,820
So some of these are really easy to see.

73
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,880
So the partial derivative of x squared y
cubed with

74
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,180
respect to x is just going to be two 2xy
cubed.

75
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,930
It's also easy to see that the partial
derivative

76
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,910
with respect to y will be 3x squared y
squared.

77
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,600
It's just the power rule and treating.

78
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,540
The other variable, so in this case y,

79
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,300
in this case x, as a constant.

80
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:07,530
And then we have to compute the mixed
partials.

81
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,930
So here I have the partial of f with
respect to x squared

82
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,440
And so I all ready know what the, the
first partial is

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,340
with respect to x, so I can just plug that
in here.

84
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,050
And then I need to take its derivative one
more

85
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,358
time with respect to x, so I get 2y cubed.

86
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,829
The actual mixed partial, so here dy then
dx.

87
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,340
And again, I've already computed the
derivative of f.

88
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,940
Or the partial derivative of f with
respect to y.

89
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,180
So, I'm just going to recycle that result
rather than do it all over again.

90
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,240
And then, of this function, I'm going to
take the derivative with respect to x.

91
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,740
So, I get 6xy squared.
And then by the theorem I had.

92
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,080
So I hope nobody did both partial
derivatives for the quiz question,

93
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,480
because that was a well-behaved function,
so you could have just taken one and

94
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,790
then said, by the theorem, the other one
has to be equal to that.

95
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,280
So, I'm going to do that here.

96
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,220
So, this is a well-behaved function.

97
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,190
I can take derivatives of a polynomial
indefinitely.

98
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,160
At some point I hit a constant.

99
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,250
And then I take the derivative of that,
and I get zero.

100
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,950
But zero is still a valid function.

101
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,420
So I can continue to take the derivative
of that indefinitely.

102
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,230
And it just stays

103
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,860
zero, but it's still differentiable.

104
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,280
Oops.
And

105
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,120
then I just have to calculate the other
second order derivative.

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,450
This time, with respect to y.

107
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,600
And again, I'll just recycle the first
first

108
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,580
partial with respect to y that I've
already computed.

109
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,320
Take thats derivative.
And so, I get 6x squared y.

110
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,080
Oh, and I guess I, I put in sort of my
hidden light to gray color here.

111
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,280
That this is equal to the

112
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,810
other partial derivatove, other mixed
partial derivative.

113
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,310
[NOISE]

114
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,920
So now I'm just going to plug these into
the gradient.

115
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,040
So the definition of the gradient is just
a partial of the function

116
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,050
with respect to x and the partial the
function with respect to y.

117
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,170
So I can just plug in those two partial

118
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,280
of derivatives that I computed on the
previous slide.

119
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,780
And

120
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,180
then if I want to evaluate the gradient at
the point 1, 2 so here I have 2 times x

121
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,648
times y cubed so this is 2 times 1, so
that's just this one right here.

122
00:07:35,648 --> 00:07:39,420
Times 2 cubed; so that's just this two
here.

123
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,160
And then 3 x squared, y squared.

124
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,370
So, 3 times 1 squared times 2 squared.
And easy enough, 16, 12.

125
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,240
And then, I"ll do exactly the same thing
for the gradient.

126
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,360
Sorry, for the Hessian.
So, first I'll just.

127
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,390
Plug in the formulas that I computed on
the previous slide, and remember

128
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,910
we get this symmetry of the off-diagonal
entries in the, in the Hessian.

129
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,556
And then when I want to evaluate the
Hessian of the point

130
00:08:05,556 --> 00:08:08,367
1,2, I just plug in one for x and two for
y.

131
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,990
And so this gives me the actual value at,
of the Hessian.

132
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,360
But only specifically at the point 1, 2.

133
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,510
If I move away from 1, 2, then these
numbers here are going to change.

134
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,330
And so, I guess.

135
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,380
Where we're going to be using this when we
get to solving problems numerically.

136
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,820
we'll be computing the gradient and the
Hessian.

137
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,410
And then that's going to give our
algorithm some idea.

138
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,920
So based on what these numbers actually
are at a certain point.

139
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,230
We're going to try to move to another
point so we'll

140
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,310
move maybe from 1, 2 to 1, 1 and the way
we're

141
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,940
going to choose where we're going to move
is going to

142
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,210
be a function of these actual numbers that
appear in here.
