1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,420
OK, so lesson six is going to be, called
Put-Call Parity and The Greeks.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,130
This will be a pretty quick lesson.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,700
I just want to introduce a couple of
concepts

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,030
that I'll use than in the next four
lessons.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:26,210
So I'll start off.
By naming V to be the value

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:32,510
of a portfolio of derivative securities
all based on one underlying asset.

7
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:37,630
So this could be, you know, more than one
option based on the same underyling asset.

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,260
Really, for, for what we're going to be
doing this week, it's going to

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,880
be just a single thing, either one call
option or one put option.

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,160
And then the rates of change of the value
V with respect to

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,890
the pricing parameter, so that would be
the asset price S, the volatility sigma.

12
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,360
These are going to be things that are
useful for hedging.

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,600
And these rates or chains are called the
Greeks of the portfolio and they're.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,660
They're basically just the different
derivatives you

15
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,580
can take of the Black-Scholes pricing
formula.

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:21,580
So we're going to consider a portfolio
containing a single European call option.

17
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,180
And basically, this week's going to work,
if you've looked at the homework already.

18
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,270
I'm going to go through the examples of
how

19
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,460
to compute the Greeks using a call option.

20
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,560
It'll be very similar, but just, a little
different, to do it for a put option.

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,090
And so the homework is going to be a put
option.

22
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,770
But you should be able to refer to the
calculations for the call option, and up

23
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,760
to just to a few things being reordered

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,630
and some different signs, it will be very
similiar.

25
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,230
And there's also, well I'll get to this in
a second,

26
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,120
first I'm just going to remind you about
the Black-Scholes formula.

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,910
So the inputs to the Black-Scholes formula
Where the asset price, s.

28
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,440
And so this is going to quite often in,

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,290
in these slides also have a t associated
with it.

30
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,350
And that just means the, the price at a
certain time t.

31
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,080
If there's no t, we kind of mean the, the
price right now.

32
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,320
And sigma is going to be the volatility.
K is the strike price.

33
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,000
So this is the, the exercise price of the
option.

34
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,930
Little r is a continuously compounded
risk-free interest rate.

35
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,110
Capital T is the maturity date.

36
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:45,590
Q is a, asset dividend rate, and this is
a, continuously compounded rate at well.

37
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,930
And then little t is going to be time, so

38
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,370
you can think of that as current, the
current time.

39
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,710
And really, the way capital T and little t
are going to

40
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,230
show up in the pricing formula is, capital
T minus little t.

41
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,230
And so that means some date in the future
minus today.

42
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,370
And so, that quantity, capital T minus
little

43
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,120
t, you can think of that as the time

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,020
left until the maturity of the, of the
contract.

45
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,870
So the Black Shoals formula for a European
call option

46
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,350
So I'm using the same notation that is
used in

47
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,890
the text book and so, this is for some
reason

48
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,220
treated as a function, just of two
variables, S and T.

49
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,230
But it's really, has several more has all
of the variables that I had

50
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,330
on the previous slide in it, so you have
the, dividend rate, you have.

51
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:43,250
Maturity, current time, strike price and
risk free interest rate.

52
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,300
And then we also have this function
capital Fi, and that's just defined

53
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,980
as the integral from minus infinity Up to
z of

54
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,530
e to the minus x squared over 2dx and then
normalized

55
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,820
by this factor of 1 over the square root
of 2 pi.

56
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,260
We have a function d plus, which is also a

57
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,700
function of all of the arguments of the
pricing formula.

58
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,670
And essentially it's not necessary to, to
write d-plus

59
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,940
as a separate function and put it in here.

60
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,090
I could actually just write the whole
thing out, but

61
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,150
again it just gets kind of unwieldy to do
that.

62
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,410
And now that we have tools, like the
product rule and the chain rule,

63
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,130
it's actually more convenient.

64
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,960
To treat functions of functions separately
like this.

65
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,830
So we had a, a d plus in the first term of
the pricing formula.

66
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,600
We have a d minus in the second term of
the pricing formula.

67
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,240
And these two functions are very similar.

68
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,659
And where, where they differ is just that
d plus.

69
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,870
Has a plus sigma, oops, okay, I can't, I
can't highlight that,

70
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,890
but has a plus sigma squared over two in
this part here.

71
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,450
And d minus is actually equal to d plus

72
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,230
minus sigma times the square root of T
minus

73
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,810
t And all that that changes is that this

74
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,650
plus sign here becomes a minus sign in d
minus.

75
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,300
So the, the plus and minus subscript on
the d here just

76
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,950
refers to whether this should be a plus
operation, or a minus operation.

77
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,070
Then there's a relationship between the
price of a

78
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,940
Put option and the price of a Call option.

79
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:46,380
So If I let C of T be the price of a
European Call option, and P of T be

80
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,340
the price of a European Put option on the
same

81
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,910
asset, with the same maturity date and the
same strike price.

82
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,629
Then the following relation holds, and
this is called Put-Call parity

83
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:03,644
And it just says that the price of the Put
option plus s

84
00:06:03,644 --> 00:06:08,880
times S times E to the minus QT minus T.

85
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,590
So, it's basically this is just what the
asset's going to be worth.

86
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,378
If it's paying some dividends, it's
going to be a little bit more.

87
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:23,930
Then, minus the value of the call option
has

88
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,680
to be equal to the discounted value.
Of the strike price.

89
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,960
And so what we're really trying to do here

90
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,080
is relate the Put price and the Call
price.

91
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,420
And so in the homework I've asked you to
do two things.

92
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:47,480
So I'm going to show you how to calculate
the derivatives of the Call price.

93
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:48,980
And then I'm

94
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,400
going to ask you to calculate the
derivatives of the put price.

95
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,340
And so what I want you to actually, in

96
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,070
the homework, compute those by taking
derivatives of the formula.

97
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,510
But you can check that you got the right

98
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,950
answer by taking derivatives of this put
call parity relationship.

99
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,170
And then just plugging in, so if I took

100
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,450
the derivative of this, for instance, with
respect to s.

101
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,590
This term would just be dcds.

102
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,310
That's going

103
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,730
to be something that I show you how to
calculate today.

104
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:22,940
And so you'll end up with an expression
for the derivative

105
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,140
of the put price with respect to S, these
two other

106
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,640
terms and something that we already know,
and so that'll give

107
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,109
you an easy way to verify that you've got
the correct answer.

108
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,520
And the Greeks are, and they just

109
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,230
the different derivatives of the, the
pricing formula.

110
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,500
But they all have names that are Greek
letters.

111
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
So that's why they're called the Greeks,
it has

112
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,590
nothing actually to do with the country of
Greece

113
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:58,010
So the rate of change of c, so it's rate
of change in general of the value of

114
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,290
the portfolio but since for today's
lecture I'm considering

115
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,230
my portfolio just to be a single call
option.

116
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,310
I'm just going to say c is the value of my
portfolio.

117
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,410
So the rate of change with C with respect
to S, is called Delta

118
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,780
and that's just going to be the partial
derivative of C with respect to S.

119
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:25,330
Second one is called Gamma which is the
rate of change of Delta with respect to S.

120
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,610
And since, so partial derivative of delta
again, with respect to s.

121
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,320
And since delta was the partial derivative
of c with respect to s, gamma

122
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,120
can also be the second partial derivative
of c with respect to s squared.

123
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,660
Then we have theta, which is the rate of
change of c with respect to t.

124
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,200
And so that'll just be the partial
derivative of c with respect to t.

125
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,380
Row, which is the rate of change of c with
respect to the risk free interest rate r.

126
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,740
So it's the partial derivative of c with
respect

127
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,730
to r And then, vega, which I'm not sure
this

128
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,710
is actually a real Greek letter, but it
sounds kind of Greek.

129
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,630
So I guess they threw it in with the, with
the group.

130
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,900
Which is the rate of change of C with
respect to sigma.

131
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,400
So partial of C with respect to sigma.
