00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,970
The topic for week three is partial
derivatives, and the menu for

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,940
week three is going to start out with
function of several variables.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,320
So, remember our goal is we want to be
able to take the partial derivatives of

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,060
the black shoals pricing formula, the
black shoals

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,120
pricing formula is a function of many
variables.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,490
So we'll start off just defining what we
mean by a function of many variables .

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,410
Then in section two I'll talk about higher
order partial derivatives.

8
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,480
So remember higher derivative was just
when

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,120
I took the derivative of a derivative.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,230
When I have a function of more than one
variable I

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,110
could take the derivative Of that function
with respect to y.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,590
That will give me a new function.

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,190
And then I could take the derivative of
that function with respect to x.

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,260
So now it's actually possible to mix the
partial

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,890
derivatives, so we have to talk a little

16
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,960
bit about how we're going to deal with
that possibility.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,020
In section three I'll give a concrete

18
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,309
example just using a function of two
variables.

19
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,890
Section four, I'll talk about an extension
of

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,220
the Chain Rule for functions of several
variables.

21
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,120
And in section five I'll talk about
implicit functions.

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,190
So, an implicit function is a function
that I can't write as Y equals F of X.

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,040
It's something a little bit more general.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,400
So, a circle, for instance, would be an
implicit function.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,220
Because when I write down it's equation it
has

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,020
to be X squared plus Y squared equals R
squared.

27
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,140
In the second half of this weeks topics,
I'll start talking about the Greeks.

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,010
And so the Greeks, recall are the

29
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,730
partial derivatives of the Black Shoals
pricing formula.

30
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,530
And I'll start off just by introducing
what the

31
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,054
Greeks are, and also a notion called
put-call parity.

32
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:50,290
And then I'll talk about four, or, the
five Greeks.

33
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:55,020
So we have Delta, which is the derivative
with respect to the asset price.

34
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,650
Gamma which is the second derivative with
respect to the asset price.

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,630
Then row vega and theta.

36
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,660
And so these will actually be just
complicated

37
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,990
calculations, but it'll be nice just to go

38
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,540
through them once I think in course with
slides so you can see how they're done.

39
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,750
There some very nice tricks you can use to
simplify the calculations that, you know,

40
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,960
if just try and do this on your own, the
first time you might not catch.
