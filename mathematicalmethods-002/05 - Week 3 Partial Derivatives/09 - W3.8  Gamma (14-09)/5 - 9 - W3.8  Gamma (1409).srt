1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,460
So moving on for the next lesson.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,800
We'll talk about gamma, which is the
derivative of delta with respect

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,860
to s, or the second derivative of c with
respect to s.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,020
So gamma is the rate of change of delta.

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,720
So I can write that as the partial
derivative with respect to s of delta.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,710
And delta is the partial derivative of c
with respect to s.

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,450
So this is just the second derivative of c
with respect to s.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,092
But again, the way I'm going to compute

9
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:37,680
it, since I've already computed this
derivative for delta.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,160
I'm going to use that as a starting point
rather than starting from scratch.

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,080
So all we have to do, since we already
have an expression for

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,940
delta, is just take the derivative with
respect to s of that again.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,404
But that turns out to be pretty difficult,
because in the last in

14
00:00:57,404 --> 00:01:02,600
the last set of slides, we, we had this
three term expression for s.

15
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,080
But luckily, there's a shortcut.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,104
So like I mentioned in the previous set,
if

17
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:10,128
we look at the second two terms in the
square

18
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:14,790
brackets here, I said that those were
going to be equal to zero.

19
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,370
But that's something that we have to show
mathematically before we can do it.

20
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,321
We did this.

21
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:21,369
I had one example of this before where I

22
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:24,825
had actually plugged in numbers for the
Black-Scholes pricing

23
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:27,321
formula, and we went through the, the work
of

24
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:30,082
showing that this part ends up being equal
to zero.

25
00:01:30,082 --> 00:01:35,162
And now we'll do it in general so we never
have to

26
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,603
do it again.

27
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:39,879
So the textbook says that delta is just
equal to

28
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,219
this much simpler expression than what
we've come up with.

29
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,984
And finding an expression for gamma is
certainly

30
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,760
going to be a lot easier if I only

31
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,498
have to take the derivative of this,
rather

32
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:56,540
than taking the derivative of all three
terms.

33
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,300
So what I'd like to do is figure

34
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,650
out a way to show that this expression
here is equal to zero.

35
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,290
And so when I, when I write something like
this, I'm not sure

36
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,170
that it's equal to zero, I want to show
that it's equal to zero.

37
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,712
So you don't want to just write down equal
to zero

38
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:18,740
and then start plugging in things and
showing that it's true.

39
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,570
What I want to do is start with this
without saying it's equal to zero.

40
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,010
And just do algebraic

41
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,930
manipulations to it, until it finally is
equal to zero.

42
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,680
And then what we'll have is, a line of
work that starts

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,160
out from what I'm given, and ends with
what I want, basically zero.

44
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,580
And that'll be an argument that anytime I
see this.

45
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,370
Expression in a calculation, I can then
replace that with zero.

46
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,139
And that's going to save us a lot of work
in,

47
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,103
the next several lessons.

48
00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:00,670
And so the strategy I'm going to use is I
have a, one term that has

49
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,910
a d plus in it and one term that has a d
minus in it.

50
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,690
But remember d minus could be written in
terms of

51
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,960
d plus just by adding a little bit to it.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,527
And so what I'm going to do is try and
manipulate the

53
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:20,442
d minus into a d plus, and then there'll
be some stuff

54
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:21,820
left over.

55
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,740
And hopefully when I factor out the stuff
that's left over, it's going to.

56
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,820
Turn this second term into the first term,
and if both of those terms are

57
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,160
the same, then when I subtract one from
the other, I'm going to get zero.

58
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:45,470
So phi of d minus is equal to 1 over the
square root of 2 pi e.

59
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,275
So I'm using some different notation here
just because it,

60
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:51,110
it gets really small if I have everything
in the exponent.

61
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,150
So, exp as a function, so exp and then
something in parentheses that means

62
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,600
exactly the same thing as e to the power
of what's ever in the parentheses here.

63
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,575
So this is 1 over the square root of 2 pi
Square root of 2 pi times

64
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:14,939
e to the minus d minus squared over 2.
And that's just the,

65
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,886
the exact definition of phi of d minus.
And

66
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:24,926
now I'm going to replace d minus in that
expression,

67
00:04:24,926 --> 00:04:29,270
with d plus minus.
Sigma times the square root of t minus t.

68
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,600
And that was just my expression for d
minus.

69
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,780
And now I have a, this quadratic, form
here.

70
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,400
So I'm going to expand that.

71
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,320
The, the first term, I'm going to end up
with a d plus squared over 2.

72
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,840
So it's pretty clear that that's going to,
that's going to get me a phi of d plus.

73
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,870
And then hopefully the stuff that's left
over is going to be useful to get this

74
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,412
result that I'm after, showing that the
second

75
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,670
term here is actually equal to the first.

76
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,954
So this is just what I had on the last bit
of the, of the previous slide.

77
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,838
So now what I'm going to do is just go
ahead and expand this quadratic

78
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:19,290
form here, and so I'll end up with d plus
squared minus 2d plus sigma

79
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:24,830
square root of t minus t plus sigma
squared times t minus t all over 2.

80
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,834
And now I'm going to regroup

81
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:32,120
the terms like this.

82
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,340
So basically, I'm just taking, ooh, got
the whole thing that time.

83
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,590
I'm just taking this d plus squared over 2
and putting that by itself.

84
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,762
Because this is now an expression, the 1
over the square root

85
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:49,410
of 2 pi E to the minus d plus squared over
two.

86
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,034
That's just and expression from phi of d
plus.

87
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:54,254
And then these two terms

88
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:59,471
are what's left over.
So the middle term that has

89
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:04,736
a two in the numerator and in the
denominator,

90
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:09,770
so those are going to cancel each other
out.

91
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:13,940
So I've, I've got from my, oh I can't
highlight anything.

92
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,328
I have my phi of d plus from this portion
of the previous line.

93
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:27,160
I have e to the d plus times sigma square
root of t minus t from this portion.

94
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,909
And then I have e, this hasn't changed

95
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:31,130
I've just written it a little bit
differently.

96
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,670
e to the minus sigma squared t minus t
divided by 2.

97
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:44,970
And now, just a quick reminder, of what d
plus is equal to so what I'm going to.

98
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:45,330
What

99
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:48,750
I have here is d plus times sigma square
root of

100
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,990
t minus t and so all these sigma square
root t

101
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,230
minus t is going to do is cancel out the
sigma

102
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,010
square root of t minus t in the
denominator of d plus.

103
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:05,680
So I, what I have is E to the numberator
of the definition of d plus here.

104
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,590
So, I'll do that in the next line.
So, all that's

105
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,650
happened is this d plus sigma square root
of t minus t has

106
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,750
just become the numerator of the
definition of d plus.

107
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,924
And then the bit on the right hand term is
still stayed

108
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:28,249
the same, just sigma squared, t minus t
over 2 and it's negative.

109
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,620
So, what's going to happen, I have e to
the log of s over k.

110
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,943
So the exponential and the logarithm, they
are.

111
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,392
Inverse functions of one another it's the,

112
00:07:47,392 --> 00:07:50,016
the exponential undoes what the logarithm
did,

113
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:52,880
so this is just going to allow me to take
an s over k out.

114
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,754
And then when I have an exponential of a
sum, that's

115
00:07:57,754 --> 00:08:00,878
equal to the, product, so this is the same
thing as e

116
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:02,130
to the log.

117
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:08,190
S over k times e to the r minus q plus
sigma squared over 2, t minus t.

118
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,528
So this bit here is going to stay in my
exponential function

119
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:21,792
but I'm going to factor out an s over k
and then also using

120
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:27,690
the same property So here I had a product
of exponentials.

121
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,657
So this is just going to be the sum of
this bit that I've

122
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:35,360
got highlighted and what's inside the
square brackets in the lower right here.

123
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,428
So that gives this s over k out of my
exponential

124
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:46,000
bit, and then leaves me with what's inside
the exponential bit here.

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,510
But now look what's happened, so this,
sigma squared t minus t

126
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,580
over two that I've been carrying down the
right side of my calculation.

127
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,628
I have a plus sigma squared over 2 times t

128
00:08:57,628 --> 00:09:02,040
minus t minus sigma squared over 2 times t
minus t.

129
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,330
So all

130
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,530
of that's going to cancel out, and I'm
just going to have r minus q.

131
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,770
That quantity times t minus t left.

132
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,650
And so now I'm going to go back to

133
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:16,100
using the notation of writing this as
exponential.

134
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,410
So, this is e to the r times t minus t.

135
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,740
So that's where this bit came from.

136
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:29,435
And then this is e to the minus q.
Times t minus t, so that's

137
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:36,335
where this bit came from and now I have a,
an expression for phi of d minus

138
00:09:36,335 --> 00:09:39,900
in terms of phi of d plus and this is the

139
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,465
expression that I am trying to show is

140
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:47,293
equal to zero again.
So I am going to substitute.

141
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:54,390
My expression here for phi of d minus into
the second term

142
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:01,356
here and I get this expression here.
And so the

143
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:06,839
first term has stayed the same but now I
have k times e to the minus r t minus t.

144
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:13,799
So that carried over from before, and now
I have what's

145
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:18,828
coming from my new expression, fee of d
plus, s divided

146
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:23,650
by k, e to the rt minus t, and e to the
minus qt minus t.

147
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,040
But here I have a k And

148
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,550
s over k, so that's going to be just s,
and I have

149
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,800
an s in the numerator, and an s in the
denominator here.

150
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,440
So all of the strike prices, and the, the
asset

151
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,350
prices are going to cancel each other out
in this term.

152
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,220
Then I have e to the minus rt minus t, and

153
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,086
e to the rt minus t.
So when I add those together I have

154
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,320
minus rt minus t plus rt minus t.

155
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,230
That's the same things as e to the zero
which is just one.

156
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,490
So, those two parts are going to cancel
each other out.

157
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:10,910
So, all I'm left with Is phi of d plus.
And e to the minus q t minus t.

158
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,580
Which is exactly what I had in the
numerator over here.

159
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,500
And now in the denominator, remember I've
canceled out this s here with this s here.

160
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,280
So I have the same denominator as well.

161
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,536
So when I do all of the canceling here,

162
00:11:28,536 --> 00:11:31,810
I've made the second term into the first
term.

163
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,160
And I'm subtracting them from one another,
so I end up having zero.

164
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,520
So that means when it's time to actually
go ahead and calculate gamma.

165
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,058
Instead of having to take the derivative
with respect to s of this

166
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:52,005
great big formula, I can rewrite that as
just the derivative

167
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:57,879
with respect to s of e to the minus q t
minus t times capital phi of d plus.

168
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:06,270
And so when I'm taking the partial
derivative with respect

169
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,320
to S, e to the minus q t minus t.

170
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,950
There's no S in that, so I can treat that
as a constant.

171
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,990
So I can move that across the derivative
operator.

172
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,784
And so all I need to do is take the

173
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:18,899
derivative with respect to s of capital
phi of d plus.

174
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,288
And I'll go through this again, but we

175
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:25,980
actually did this already when we were
computing delta.

176
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,255
So, I'm taking the derivative of a
function of d plus

177
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:33,770
with respect to s so I have to use the
chain rule.

178
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,700
And that tells me that I can take the
derivative of capital phi of d plus.

179
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:43,530
And then I have to multiply that by the
derivative of d plus with respect to s.

180
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,880
And we've all ready calculated that as
well so.

181
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:55,440
partial derivative of either d plus or d
minus with respect to s.

182
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,860
It's just one over s times sigma times the
square root of t minus t

183
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,581
And then this we've already seen before
let's say this is the derivative of our

184
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:07,912
indefinite integral so this is just
going to to

185
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,855
be equal to lowercase phi of d plus.

186
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:19,340
So what I'm left with is that e to the
minus qt minus t that I had out here.

187
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:26,240
The 1 over s times sigma times the square
root of t minus t that came

188
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,900
from the chain rule so that's in the
denominator in the front here.

189
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,700
And, then, the lower case fee of d plus,

190
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,690
which was just a derivative that I got
here.

191
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,050
And so, we now have an expression for
gamma, which is the partial

192
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,230
derivative with respect to S of, sorry, of
delta with respect to S.

193
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,690
And this is exactly the same as the line
above it.

194
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,810
I've just replaced phi of d plus with the
actual definition of phi of d plus.

195
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:04,040
So, it's 1 over the square root of 2 pi.
E to the minus d plus squared over 2, so.

196
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,029
Looks like I missed a little bit because I
forgot the square

197
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:09,667
there, but this should be d plus squared
over 2.
