1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,980
Okay.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,940
Second half of number seven, so week seven
is Taylor series.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,538
So I'm going to go over something called

4
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:12,880
Taylor's formula for a function of one
variable.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,240
And then just introduce a concept called"
Big O" notation.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,570
Hopefully a lot of you have seen this
before but it's a pretty simple idea.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,270
Just give you an idea of how fast a
function is growing or shrinking.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,114
Then

9
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:28,695
I'll talk about a generalization of

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,150
Taylor's formula to functions of several
variables.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,850
Something called Taylor series expansions.

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,680
And then some applications to bond
convexes.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,179
So this is just carrying on from one of
the lectures from the

14
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:47,350
first week, where I talked about making a
linear approximation to our function.

15
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,235
And now we can add more terms to

16
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:52,100
that approximation to make it a little bit
better.

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,120
So I'll start off with Taylor's formula
for a function of one variable.

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,647
So my function is going to be f of x

19
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:06,770
and I'm going to assume that it's at least
n times differentiable.

20
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,140
So when I say that I mean I can take the
derivative of f of x to get f prime.

21
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,744
And then I can take the derivative of f
prime to get f

22
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:17,650
double prime and I can continue doing that
until I have n primes.

23
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,470
And each one of those functions is going
to be a differentiable function.

24
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,242
Then I'm also going to assume that a is
some

25
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:25,170
real number.

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,350
And the Taylor polynomial of order n
around the

27
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,460
point a is just defined to be this thing
here.

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,390
So what I do.

29
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,970
So I evaluate my function at the point a.

30
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,516
So the idea is, I know the value of my
function

31
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:44,990
at certain points and so I'm going to pick
one of those.

32
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,910
So a is going to be that point.

33
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,190
And then for points that are near a, I'm

34
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,250
just going to use the derivatives to make
an approximation.

35
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,690
And basically what's going on with this
polynomial, I

36
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,387
have x minus a times the first derivative.
I have x minus

37
00:02:04,387 --> 00:02:09,166
a squared, times the second derivative
divided by two.

38
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:14,616
And then I can just keep going and the
general formula is

39
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:20,066
going to be x minus a to the kth power
times the kth derivative

40
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:23,990
evaluated at a, divided by k factorial.

41
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,710
And so that's just what the, the final
term here is.

42
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,730
Except that the last one is n, because I
said it's a Taylor polynomial of order n.

43
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,682
So that just means I go up until I'm using
x minus a

44
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:40,059
to the nth power and then that's the last
term in my Taylor polynomial.

45
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,158
And the idea of this Taylor polynomial is
that I want to be

46
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:49,190
able to use it to approximate f of a at
points x that are near a.

47
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,263
And so I can write this in a little bit
more compact notation just

48
00:02:57,263 --> 00:03:02,090
like this, so I'm, I'm going from zero up
to n, so here's the.

49
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,082
Here's the nth term on the right here and

50
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:08,778
I can think of just evaluating the
function as

51
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:09,218
[COUGH]

52
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:12,360
as taking the zeroth derivative.

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,913
And then there's no x minus a here because
anything to the zero power is just one.

54
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,220
And so I want to use P sub n to
approximate f of x.

55
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,672
And so that the idea here is if I just
approximated f

56
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:34,619
of x by f of a, you know that might be
reasonably close.

57
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,910
it would just depend on how steep the
function was and how far away from a I am.

58
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,393
And then I could make my, my approximation
a little

59
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:47,309
bit better by if I, if I know the
derivative

60
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:48,980
of my function at a.

61
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,170
Then I can use a linear approximation on
either side of a.

62
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,718
And then I could make it again a little
bit better by adding a quadratic term so

63
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:59,268
I add a little bit of a parabola

64
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:03,420
and hopefully that'll make the
approximation a bit better.

65
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,291
And so the idea is as P sub n, as I add
more terms I'm getting

66
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:12,426
a better and better approximation of f of
x, but I want to be able to understand

67
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:15,130
how how good my approximation is.

68
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,600
And so that's what most of today's lecture
is going to be.

69
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,690
So the questions are does P sub n.

70
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,240
Whoops I've got this wrong so this should
be f of x.

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,290
But does P sub n of x converge to n, f of
x as n goes to infinity.

72
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,879
So as I add more terms.

73
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,400
You know, it's going to be a lot more work
to calculate

74
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,750
[UNKNOWN]

75
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,150
all these additional terms, so I want to
at least know that

76
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,690
each term I'm adding is getting me closer
to what I want.

77
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,750
And then order means how well does P sub n
approximate f of x?

78
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,370
So, suppose that this actually did
converge to f of x.

79
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,260
I would still need an infinite number of
terms to get exactly f of x.

80
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,580
So I'd like to know suppose I want to use
a third order polynomial.

81
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,680
You know, how far away from f of x am I?

82
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,112
So we'll

83
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:13,299
measure that distance using something
called approximation error.

84
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,135
And that's just going to be defined to be
the difference

85
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:19,950
between f of x and P sub n of x.

86
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,814
So P sub n of x is my polynomial that I'm
using for approximation and

87
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:29,470
then f of x is the target, that's the
function that I'm trying to approximate.

88
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,860
And if I, if I measure the error using an
order n.

89
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,900
Taylor polynomial.

90
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,215
I call

91
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:37,855
that the nth order Taylor approximation
error.

92
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:38,470
[COUGH]

93
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,513
And there are two forms, there are two
ways for me

94
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:48,480
to get a, a handle on the approximation
error.

95
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,360
So there's, the first one is called the
derivative form.

96
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,635
An so now, I had to assume that f of x was
least n times differentiable

97
00:05:57,635 --> 00:05:59,435
in order to be able to make the

98
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:03,890
Taylor polynomial that I'm using to
approximate it.

99
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,118
If

100
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:09,590
I assume that I can take one more
derivative than that

101
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,845
and that, that derivative is a continuous
function.

102
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:20,037
Then there's a point c, so c is just some
point in the

103
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:24,974
interval between a and x.
So a is the point where

104
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:29,710
I've expanded my, my Taylor polynomial.

105
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,521
So I'm writing my Taylor polynomial in
powers of x minus a.

106
00:06:33,521 --> 00:06:36,832
And then x is the point where I'm trying
to evaluate

107
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:40,845
the function, so ideally you want to have
x pretty close to a.

108
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:41,315
[COUGH]

109
00:06:41,315 --> 00:06:44,511
And then there's going to be some point c
in

110
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:49,070
between a and x where the following
relationship holds.

111
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:54,720
So I have x minus a to the n plus one, so
sort of looks like it's the next term.

112
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,179
But instead of evaluating the derivative
at a exactly?

113
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:02,790
I'm going to evaluate it at this point c,
that's somewhere between x and a.

114
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,526
And that's and then I need to divide

115
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,190
by the n plus one factorial.

116
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,614
And that's actually not just an
approximation of

117
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:13,910
the air, but that's exactly equal to the
air.

118
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,940
So it depends.

119
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,193
On the choice of c but there's some choice
of c in this interval ax.

120
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:23,988
Where the approximation error I have
highlighted on the left hand

121
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:27,325
side is exactly equal to the thing on the
right hand side.

122
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:27,965
[COUGH]

123
00:07:27,965 --> 00:07:35,390
And then there's also an integral form of
the approximation error.

124
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,020
So again I need the, the same condition.

125
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,770
But now I can express the Taylor
approximation error.

126
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,225
So the thing on the left hand side is, is
the same for both both

127
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:55,465
forms of the Taylor approximation error
for the

128
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:59,515
differentia, derivative form meant for the
integral form

129
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:00,161
[COUGH].

130
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:02,867
And now on the right hand side instead of

131
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:06,393
having this thing that looks like the next
term, it

132
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:09,755
looks more like the, the final term in the
Taylor

133
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:14,994
polynomial except it's multiplied by the n
plus first derivative.

134
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,530
And now I'm going to integrate this with
respect to t from a to x.

135
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,430
And so I've made this, this, I guess it
kind of looks like a Taylor term

136
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,900
but I now instead of having x minus a, I
have x minus t.

137
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,030
And then I'm also evaluating the n plus
first derivative at the point t.

138
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,609
But this is just a function.

139
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,180
And then I'm just going to multiply it by
this factor out in front.

140
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,390
That'll be another function.

141
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,900
I integrate that function with respect to
t and then use the limits a to x.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,280
And now that's going to be again exactly
equal to the Taylor approximation error.

143
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,930
But this has

144
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,990
a sort of added bonus that there's not
this kind of indeterminate c.

145
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,260
So this is something you can just compute
directly but it's, it ends

146
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,700
up being a bit more work because to get
this form here, you've already taken

147
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,630
n plus or n derivatives, so you just have
to take one more derivative.

148
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,516
And you're basically finished with this
form up

149
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:21,340
here, except that you don't know what c
is.

150
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,966
Here, you do have to still take one more
derivative but then you have potentially

151
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,754
a complicated integral you have to
evaluate, to

152
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:33,809
figure out what the Taylor approximation
error is.

153
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,330
So let's look at a quick example.

154
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,419
I'm going to make a linear approximation
of the function f

155
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:46,840
of x equals log x around the point a
equals one.

156
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,490
So the black curve is just log x.

157
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,570
That's my target function.

158
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,850
I'm going to use a first order so P,
whoops

159
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,080
I guess I can't highlight stuff in the
picture.

160
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,545
P sub one of x is just a Taylor polynomial
of order one,

161
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:08,416
so that's just a linear approximation.
My point a was chosen because

162
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:14,900
I know log, log of one is a particularly
easy thing to evaluate, it's zero.

163
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,410
So the red line touches the curve at the
point x equals a.

164
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,074
So it's one zero.

165
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:27,774
And then you can see sort of in this
interval here maybe, plus or minus a

166
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:29,382
quarter from one.

167
00:10:29,382 --> 00:10:32,151
It's actually a pretty good approximation
of

168
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:35,039
the function that I'm trying to
approximate.

169
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,604
[COUGH]

170
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:43,290
And so this is the, this is the general
form for our order one Taylor polynomial.

171
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,840
And then the derivative of log is just one
over x.

172
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,320
When I evaluate that at my point a equals
one, I just get one.

173
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,470
So this is my derivative one over one.

174
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:00,430
My point a is one, so I have x minus one
that quantity to the first power.

175
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,750
And then f of a is equal to log of one
which is zero.

176
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,572
So it turns out that x minus one is my
first order

177
00:11:07,572 --> 00:11:13,023
Taylor polynomial to approximate log x at
the point a equals one.

178
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,952
So now let's look at Taylor approximation
error and again I'm

179
00:11:21,952 --> 00:11:25,930
going to choose another point where it's
going to be easy to evaluate this.

180
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,080
So I'm going to choose x equals e, so the
log of e will just be equal to one.

181
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,840
So at log of one was zero, log of e is
one.

182
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,126
So that'll mean that I can figure out
easily

183
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:40,360
what the value on the left hand side is.

184
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,462
And let's see if we get the same thing
using the integral

185
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:45,820
form of the Taylor approximation error.

186
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,366
So the definition here, I have my limits
are going

187
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:52,529
to be a to x, so that's one up to x.

188
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,150
X minus t to the first power over one
factorial times f.

189
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,830
So, first derivative take the derivative
of that again, so f double prime.

190
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,170
And then I'm going to integrate that with
respect to t.

191
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,878
So I said I want to find the Taylor
approximation error at the point x

192
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:17,320
equals e, so the first thing I'm going to
do is just replace the x's in this.

193
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,060
With e's.

194
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,600
And now t is my variable of integration.

195
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,959
So hopefully it should be pretty easy to
see that this is just going to be so

196
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,160
I have minus t times negative one over t.
That just becomes one over t.

197
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,750
Then I have e.

198
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:41,940
times minus one over t squared, so that
gives me minus e over t squared.

199
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,990
That gives me log of t plus e over t,
evaluated at e and one.

200
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:54,150
And then on the left hand side the, it's
pretty easy to figure out what this is.

201
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,140
So I just end up with log of e.

202
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,760
Minus e plus one, so log of e was one.

203
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,877
So I get one plus one is two and then I

204
00:13:01,877 --> 00:13:04,670
still have this minus e, so I get two
minus e.

205
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,941
And on the right hand side I evaluate my
integrand at

206
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:15,620
the upper limit and subtract it, evaluate
it at the lower limit.

207
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,686
And so I end up with log of e which is
one, plus e

208
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:25,550
over e which is another one minus log of
one which is zero plus e.

209
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:29,310
So this is going to be two and this is
going to be e.

210
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:36,049
So I get two minus e as the approximation
error on both sides.

211
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:37,990
Yeah?

212
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,550
>> Why are you integrating from one to
x?

213
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,626
Where did that one come from?

214
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:48,240
>> So that domain of integration is a to
x.

215
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,640
And so I did my expansion around the point
a equals one.

216
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,360
So I guess maybe up here I should have put
an a.

217
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,845
And then when I replace these with the

218
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:00,480
actual values it would be one to e.

219
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,740
Because I'm, I've built an extension at
the point a.

220
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,580
And I'm trying to evaluate how good that
is at the point e.

221
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,190
So now let's see if we can figure out the

222
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,180
same thing using the derivative form of
the Taylor approximation here.

223
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,028
I guess one thing I wanted to point out,

224
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:22,435
let's just remember that the approximation
error was about 0.7.

225
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:23,020
[COUGH]

226
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,179
So I want to know what is the Taylor

227
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:31,320
approximation error again at the point x
equals e.

228
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,532
So I built a Taylor polynomial around at
the point a equals one and

229
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:40,060
then I want to see how well that
approximates f at the point x equals e.

230
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:48,480
So this is my formula for the derivative
form of the Taylor approximation error.

231
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,648
And again f double prime here is going to
be one over x for

232
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:05,000
the first derivative and then minus one
over x squared for the second derivative.

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,660
So I get this minus and then I'm
evaluating it

234
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,890
at c, so this is where the c squared came
from.

235
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,690
I have a two factorial, that's where this
two came from.

236
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,792
And then I'm interested in the point x
equals e, so I'm going to replace

237
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,330
the x with an e, so I get e minus one
squared in the numerator.

238
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,485
And now, because I happen to know what the
true value of the Taylor

239
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:35,406
approximation error is on the left hand
side, I can solve for this point c.

240
00:15:35,406 --> 00:15:40,388
And so what I get is that c is equal to
1.434 roughly so the,

241
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:45,650
these are probably irrational numbers, so
they go on forever.

242
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,300
But I've just rounded them to rounded them
to three decimal places.

243
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,050
E is definitely an irrational number.

244
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,500
So it has an infinite decimal
representation.

245
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,850
[COUGH]

246
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,000
And so I found that c is in fact in
between.

247
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,658
So a was equal to one.

248
00:16:02,658 --> 00:16:05,960
And then x was equal to e.

249
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,340
So I found that the value c is in that
interval.

250
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,580
[COUGH]

251
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,964
But I had to know what the Taylor
approximation error was

252
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:17,030
in order to be able to find that value of
c.

253
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,030
So you might ask how is that useful?

254
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:25,320
[COUGH]

255
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,180
And so what we are actually able to do

256
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,970
with this, is we can't find with the
derivative form

257
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,760
the exact value of the Taylor
approximation error but

258
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,680
you can find a bound on the Taylor
approximation error.

259
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,474
So I know that the true approximation
error

260
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:42,952
is going to, for this particular example
so normally this

261
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:45,690
would either be ax or xa depending on
whether

262
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,250
x is greater than a or less than a.

263
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,382
But in this example I know my a is

264
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:55,815
equal to one and my x is equal to e.
So I know there's some point c

265
00:16:55,815 --> 00:17:01,270
in between one and e where the true
approximation error is going to occur.

266
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,320
And then what I want to do.

267
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:13,359
Is say well that, the absolute value of
the error then must be less than or

268
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:19,200
equal to the maximum value this function
takes on the interval one e.

269
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,720
And so that's going to say well I, I

270
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,940
don't know exactly what the Taylor
approximation error is.

271
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,889
But I can tell you that it's definitely
less than whatever

272
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:35,670
value I'm going to calculate on the right
hand side here.

273
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,505
And so in this case if I, if I take the
absolute value of the expression I

274
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:41,650
had on the previous slide, I end up with

275
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,210
e minus one squared divided by two c
squared.

276
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,830
And now I want to find the value of c
that's going to make this the biggest.

277
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,752
And so it turns out this is, if I put in,
so since I'm dividing by

278
00:17:55,752 --> 00:18:00,860
c, if I want to make this thing big I
want to make c as small as I can.

279
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,632
But c has to be in this interval one e, so
the

280
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:08,370
smallest I can make c and still stay in
that interval is one.

281
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,940
So that tells me that the absolute value
of

282
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,530
this Taylor approximation error is less
than or equal

283
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:22,610
to one half e minus one squared and that's
equal to about 1.476.

284
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:28,635
So my bound on the error is roughly twice
what the actual error is.

285
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:31,455
because if you remember from the integral
form we were able to

286
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:35,370
find it exactly and it was about 0.7
something, the absolute value was.

287
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,840
And so the idea here is?
If this is not good enough.

288
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,440
So if I want my approximation to be better
than within 1.476 of the true value,

289
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,575
then I need to use a more complicated
polynomial to make my approximation.

290
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:56,711
But I also need to know that polynomial

291
00:18:56,711 --> 00:19:00,669
is actually getting closer as I add more
terms.

292
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:09,440
And so this lets me put a bound on the
Taylor approximation error.

293
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,966
So this is the Taylor approximation error
using a

294
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:17,390
first order Taylor polynomial expanded
around the point a.

295
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,990
And this is the error at the point x
equals e.

296
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,240
And I know that I'm within 1.47 of the
true value.
