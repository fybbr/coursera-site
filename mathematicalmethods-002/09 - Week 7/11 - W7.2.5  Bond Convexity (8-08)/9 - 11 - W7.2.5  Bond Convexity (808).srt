1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,610
Okay, and then I'm going to visit one more
topic, quickly from the first week.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,604
So I talked about something called bond
duration, and

3
00:00:10,604 --> 00:00:13,560
it turned out that, was just a linear
approximation.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,804
So I was using the derivative, to make a

5
00:00:15,804 --> 00:00:18,800
linear approximation of a yield curve, for
a bond.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,150
So this is the, the yield curve for a
bond.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,389
The price formula, so the price of a bond
is the,

8
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:32,530
it's essentially, it's just the discounted
value of the futures stream.

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:37,829
So, what I'm going to get paid, is the
face value of the bond, in n periods.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,642
And then sort of my reward, for giving
somebody money now, that they're going to

11
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:47,010
pay me back in the future, is they're

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,030
going to make coupon payments every every
month.

13
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,600
And so, this actually should have had
parentheses around it.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,812
And so what, what I'm after here

15
00:00:57,812 --> 00:01:02,078
is just the discounted value of this
stream of coupon payments,

16
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:06,570
plus the discounted value of the face
value when the bond matures.

17
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,010
So I have coupon payment, number of
periods remaining.

18
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:16,430
So N is just how many periods I have to
wait before I get my money back.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,860
F is the face value, so that's what I get.

20
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,935
That's sort of usually it's how much I
have sold

21
00:01:22,935 --> 00:01:23,867
the bond for.

22
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:26,694
And then I just get, my money back some
time in the future.

23
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:30,545
And then lambda, you can think of this as
the interest rate.

24
00:01:30,545 --> 00:01:34,225
But it's, for a bond it's called yield for
maturity.

25
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:34,875
[COUGH]

26
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:41,910
And so last time, I said we can make a, a
linear approximation.

27
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,820
So I, I introduced this concept called
duration, but then I, I showed

28
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,670
that it was basically just a, a simple
transformation of the first derivative.

29
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,940
And so I could use that to make a linear
approximation to my bond.

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:59,750
And so if I did that at the point 10% and
100.

31
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,920
And you can see, you know, maybe between

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,790
8% and 12%, the linear approximation is
pretty good.

33
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,563
But you know, if you deviate a long way
from there, then

34
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:12,500
the distance between the actual price and
the approximation gets pretty big.

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,560
And I said, we could improve this by
adding a quadratic term.

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,660
And so we'll see that, that quadratic term
is just, a degree 2 Taylor polynomial.

37
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,990
So, the quadratic term is called
convexity.

38
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,745
And we just have to compute it, by looking

39
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:36,330
at the present value of the future stream
of payments.

40
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,860
So if I say ak is the amount that I'm
going to receive after, in the kth period.

41
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,790
Then I want to find the present value of
that amount.

42
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,024
Just by discounting it, by a factor that's
equal to 1 plus the yield

43
00:02:51,024 --> 00:02:51,930
to maturity.

44
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,727
And then I'll say that, the price of the
current

45
00:02:56,727 --> 00:03:01,740
price of the bond is just equal to the
sum.

46
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,580
Of the present values of all of the future
payments I'll receive.

47
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,260
And that's equal to the sum of all of
these amounts discounted by 1 plus lambda.

48
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:22,480
Then the term convexity is defined to be,
1 over P times the second derivative.

49
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,710
Of this price formula with respect to
lambda.

50
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,630
And, so I said the price was equal to this
thing over here.

51
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,855
And, so I'm going to just put 1 over p
times the price, and instead of having

52
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,260
this in the denominator, I just think I
make

53
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,450
fewer mistakes when I can use the power
rule.

54
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,120
So I write that as, 1 minus lambda to the
minus k instead.

55
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:58,315
And then the only thing that has a lambda
in

56
00:03:58,315 --> 00:04:01,540
it is this term here.

57
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,378
So I'm going to move my derivative
operator across

58
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,310
the 1 over P and then across the sum.

59
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,656
So we have this linearity property,
remember, so the

60
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:11,820
derivative of a sum is the sum of the
derivative.

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,404
And then in 1 step I will take 2
derivatives, so

62
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:20,260
I add this to the minus k, so I get, k

63
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,620
here, and then a k plus 1, and since I'm
doing

64
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,960
it twice, the minus signs are going to
cancel each other out.

65
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,840
And then I end up with minus k plus 2 in
the denominator.

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,260
So the denominator, the power's getting
smaller.

67
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,642
And you can write this as 1 over p, so I'm
going to take this plus

68
00:04:43,642 --> 00:04:49,100
2 here, and write it as 1 over p times the
quantity 1 plus lambda squared.

69
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,835
And then I have inside this sum, k times k
plus 1 times

70
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,578
these a sub k divided, so

71
00:04:54,578 --> 00:04:58,840
that the discounted feature payments again
essentially.

72
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,450
And now I need a point, where I can make
my approximation.

73
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,695
So I all ready saw that in my graph it was
the point.

74
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:12,679
10% and 100 so that gives me a lambda note
and a P0,

75
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:18,225
so, so some point where I've actually
evaluated the, the price of the bond.

76
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:24,159
Then I have Dm, as something called the
modified duration and C as the convexity,

77
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:31,093
that we calculated on the last slide.
And so if you look in the investment

78
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:35,251
science textbook, you'll find that just,
the change in price

79
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,870
of the bond is approximately equal to
minus the modified

80
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,720
duration, times the price times the change
in the interest

81
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,510
rate, plus 1 half times the price times
the convexity.

82
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,770
Times the change in the interest rate
squared.

83
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,816
And so let's just try and write this out
into

84
00:05:54,816 --> 00:05:58,310
things that look more familiar for, with
what we've just done.

85
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,441
So I'll say delta P, that's just going to
be the difference between P and P0.

86
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:09,146
So I'll leave the P on the left, lefthand
side

87
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:13,801
right here, but I'll move the P0 to the
righthand side,

88
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:17,411
so I have P0 minus the modified duration

89
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:21,225
times the price times lambda minus lambda
0.

90
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:26,574
So that's delta lambda, I'm just going to
think of that as lambda minus lambda 0.

91
00:06:26,574 --> 00:06:31,890
And then 1 half price times convexity
times lamba minus lambda 0 squared.

92
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,530
And if I go back and substitute in how

93
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,142
we got these terms in the first place, the
modified

94
00:06:39,142 --> 00:06:44,518
duration time price and price times
convexity, both of those just came from

95
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:50,490
the derivatives of this price formula for
the bond with respect to lambda.

96
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,901
So the first one is just dP d-lambda,
evaluated at P0.

97
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:59,221
And then price times convexity, that's the
same thing as the second derivative of

98
00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:04,292
P with respect to lambda evaluated at P0.
So really all we've done,

99
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:07,030
when we use modified duration and
convexity

100
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,636
to approximate the, the price of a bond.

101
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:17,070
we've used order 2 Taylor polynomial to,
to approximate the same thing.

102
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,430
And so just to finish up this is the, the
picture of what that looks like.

103
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,875
So the, the blue curve is the actual price
curve, yield curve of the bond.

104
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:30,370
[COUGH]

105
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,716
And the dashed black line is the linear
approximation, and then

106
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:40,856
the red line is the order 2 approximation.
And so again in

107
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:45,930
maybe, maybe a little bit wider now maybe
6 or 7 to

108
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,520
about 13 or 14, we have a good
approximation.

109
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,488
But then as we get into more extreme
values, much further away from the point

110
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:58,060
we used to build the approximation.

111
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,284
The the true yield curve is deviating from
our approximation, and so on

112
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:04,000
this side it's higher than the

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,760
approximations, and on this side it's
lower.
