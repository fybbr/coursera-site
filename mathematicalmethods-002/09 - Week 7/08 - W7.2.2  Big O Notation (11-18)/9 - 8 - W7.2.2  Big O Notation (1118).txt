So, the next section is Big O Notation.
So, Big O Notation came from looking at
polynomials of degree n as
x goes to infinity, so now, the n is
fixed, but it's the argument
of the polynomial the that.
X value, that's going to be getting large.
And I want to have a measure of how fast
this polynomial is getting big.
And so it turns out that, so it should be
as x goes to
infinity, the highest order term dominates
the other.
So what, what I can do is locate the limit
of my polynomial
as x goes to infinity divided by x to the
n.
So x to the n is the highest, it's x to
the highest power.
It's x to the degree of the polynomial.
So I can write my polynomial like this,
it's just the time sum of a coefficient
times
a constant term plus a coefficient times x
plus a coefficient times x squared, and so
on.
Up to a coefficient times x to the n, so
that'll be the last term.
So there's one term in the numerator here
that's a coefficient times x to the n.
And
I'm going to divide that sum by x to the n
and what I'm going to get
is 1 term that is a sub n times x to the n
divided by x to the n.
So that is just going to be a times
x to the n And then each additional term,
because
the term on top is the power to the
smaller than, than n The x is going to
move down
to the denominator And so if I take the
limit of each of these terms as x goes to
infinity each of these terms is going to
get smaller and smaller and smaller.
While this a sub n coefficient from the xn
term is going to remain
constant and actually when I take this
limit what I'm going to end up
with is a to the n.
And so, Big O Notation is just trying to
summarise this behaviour in a
simpler way And so, I'm going to say the
polynomial p of x is Big O of x to the n.
So the way you can sort of think is if you
look at x to the n or
the polynomial and sort of zoomed out.
What is this going
to look like?
So if you had a very small scale
so all the terms are going to contribute
something.
So suppose I was looking at x squared plus
x plus 1 so each term is contributing
eaqually.
When I evaluate it at the point 1,000,
now the x squared term is contributing a
million.
The x term is contributing 1,000, and x,
er the constant term
is contributing just 1.
So on kind of a percentage wise bit the
million is dominating that
and so as I zoom out all I'm going to see
is a parabola.
And whatever effect the x and the 1 have,
at a smaller scale
their just going to disappear as I keep
moving to larger and larger scales.
And so because that polynomial would look
like a parabola
as I sort of zoomed out and just continued
zooming out.
I'm going to say that, that would be order
of x squared or order x to the 2.
And so formally the way we're going to
determine Big O Notation is
let f and g functions.
So the fruncs, functions from
the real numbers with a real output and
then I'll
say f of x is big O of g of x as x goes to
infinity.
If they're.
Is some constant c, and some constant m
both greater than 0.
So I'm not really concerned with sign
here,
all I'm concerned with is just relative
magnitude.
So if f of x divided by g of x, as x is
getting larger and larger and larger, if
this ratio is bounded by a constant.
So, for instance in the last example, it
was just this
coefficient on the highest degree term of
the polynomial a sub n.
whenever x is greater than some fixed real
number, so that this
is just me trying to take advantage of the
definition of a limit.
Then, we'll say that.
f of x is big O of g of x, so they
grow at the same rate after x exceeds some
threshold.
Similarly, we can sort
of spin this around for finite points.
So generally, when I'm thinking of x going
off to infinity, I'm thinking of things
getting bigger.
So the function of x is getting bigger and
I'm interested in,
you know, are f and g growing at the same
rate?
You know, up to a constant of
proportionality?
Or is f growing, you know, at some faster
rate?
Y'know, so if f was a polynomial of degree
3, and g was a
polynomial of degree 2, then there
wouldn't
be a value c that kept this bounded.
On the other hand, when I, I look at a
finite point.
So now I'm thinking about x going to a,
rather than x goes to infinity.
So I pick some real number a.
And I want to think, how does f of x
behave as I move closer and closer to a?
Then, I still want to have this constant c
which is sort of
my constant of proportionality, but now
I'm going to have a width, delta.
And so I want to say that f of x and g of
x, so f of x divided by g of
x, the ratio of that magnitude is less
than or equal
to this constant of proportionality
whenever x is within delta of a.
So, in some neighbourhood around the point
a, f of x and g of x have the same.
So, when it goes to infinity I say sort of
growth characteristic here.
I, I suppose I should say it shrink
characteristic or something like that.
And so what I'm after in this case with
the second definition is
I want to understand how big the Taylor
approximation error is.
And so I want to understand that, as the
point where I'm making my
approximation, gets closer and closer and
closer
through the point a where I've built
my approximation.
And now, so if, if.
If I'm looking at things getting big, you
know, quadratic or cubic that's sort of
bad.
That's saying, well, x is already getting
big and x squared
or x cubed is getting big much, much
faster than that.
And in that case it would be the
highest order term that's sort of going to
dominate.
When I look at things getting small, so if
I take 1 and square it, I get 1.
If I take something smaller than 1 and
square it,
I get a number smaller than what I started
with.
And so there it's going to be the smaller
power that's going to be the dominant one.
And so what I'm, what I want to be able to
show here, is that the Taylor
approximation error is big O.
So that the distance between the point,
where I'm evaluating my Taylor polynomial
and
the point a where I've constructed my
Taylor polynomial.
The larger I can make this number, the
faster this error is
going to get smaller as I move towards a.
So once I'm sort
of within 1 of a, this quantity is going
to be less than 1.
And when I start taking powers of that
it's going to get small.
And then the larger the power I can, I can
make.
The faster this is going to get small,
as I move closer and closer to a.
So I can also just rewrite this as one of
the terms in my Taylor
polynomial approximation.
So I've said that.
f of x minus the approximation at x is
order x minus
a to the n plus 1.
And this is again, as x is going to a.
So it's not trying to say how bad does the
approximation get as I move away from
a, it's trying to tell me how good does
the approximation get as I move towards a.
And I can just add the polynomial to both
sides, so I move the
p sub n of x over to the right hand side
of the equality.
And then replace that with, the
definition.
And so what you see is here I have a, the
constant part of the
approximation, then I would have the
linear part
of the approximation, the quadratic part
of the
approximation and so on.
And I end up with my last term being a
sort of nth degree approximation term.
And then the amount that I missed by is
going to be
on the order on x minus a to the 10 plus
first power.
Again, as a is moving towards x.
And what this allows us to say is, for
instance, the linear approximation.
So here's my Taylor polynomial of order 1.
So I have a, a constant part of the
approximation
and then I have the linear part of the
approximation.
And then what's left over is big O of x
minus a squared.
The quadratic approximation, then, is
going
to be a third-order approximation,
because.
Both so where this term is coming from is
from either the
derivative form or the or the integral
form of the Taylor approximation error.
So I have the x minus a cubed is the, the
size of.
That's describing the growth of the
approximation error.
How fast it, I suppose, shrinks as x goes
to a.
And I don't really care about the
constant of proportionality, I just want
to know if I use
this approximation, and then I move twice
as close to a.
This term is going to get smaller at a, at
a cubic rate.
And so again the, the larger I can make
this power.
So this is just me adding more terms.
Then as x goes to a means I'm getting
closer
and closer to the thing that I want to be
getting.
at a faster and faster rate, so as this
number gets bigger and bigger.
