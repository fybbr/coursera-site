00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:06,030
Welcome to week seven of Mathematical
Methods for Quantitative Finance.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,083
This week I'm going to cover two topics,
the first is

3
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:14,572
Lagrange's Method, which is a method for
solving constrained optimization problems.

4
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:17,164
And the second topic is Taylor Series, and

5
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:21,820
this is basically polynomial expansions of
nonlinear functions.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,363
That are going to make that are going to
make it possible to compute

7
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:29,980
decimal representations of of those
functions.

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,280
So this week's menu, I'm going to start
off.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,960
So the first five lectures will be on will
be on the subject of Lagrange method.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,390
I'll start off with optimal investment
portfolios.

11
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,398
And so this is, a type of constrained
optimization

12
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:51,250
problem, that, that occurs quite often in
a financial setting.

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,286
So, if you've already have a, a set of
assets that you

14
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:57,586
want to buy, say you have ten stocks, and
you have a certain

15
00:00:57,586 --> 00:01:00,029
amount of money to use to buy those
stocks.

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,782
Then you want to choose how much of each
one to buy with the constraint that the

17
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:10,970
sum of all of those has to be the amount
of money you're going to be using.

18
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,920
And then optimal means you want to have
some sort of optimal criteria.

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,542
So you might want to minimize the risk of
that portfolio

20
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:21,930
or you might want to maximize the expected
return of that portfolio.

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,130
So in the first section I'll just describe
the problem I'm trying to solve.

22
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,960
Then I'll talk a little bit about

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,380
relative extrema for functions of several
variables.

24
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,510
So we saw already that if I had a function
of one variable, if I wanted to

25
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,030
find the local minimum or a local maximum,

26
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,890
I had to use first and second order
conditions.

27
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,010
So the first order condition gave me the
critical points.

28
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,482
And then the second order condition
allowed me to classify those critical

29
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:50,470
points as either a maximum or a minimum.

30
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,748
And in section two, I'm going to go over
how

31
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:56,300
you can do that now for functions of
several variables.

32
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,270
Section three, I'll describe Lagrange's
Method.

33
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,979
Section four, I'll give an example; so
actually

34
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:07,760
solve a constrained optimization problem
using Lagrange's Method.

35
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,925
And then in section five, I'll go back to

36
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:13,718
one of the investment portfolios I talked
about in section

37
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:16,600
one, called the Minimum Variance
Portfolio.

38
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,460
And this turns out to be, have a very nice
properties.

39
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,678
So when you put this problem into the
Lagrange's Method, you end up

40
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:28,030
with a linear system, so ax equals b to
solve for the critical point.

41
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,250
So this builds very nicely on some of the
topics we just learned in linear algebra.

42
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,025
Then in the second half of this

43
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:39,030
week's lecture I'm going to talk about
Taylor's Formula.

44
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,620
So first I'll start off just by going

45
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,560
over Taylor's formula for a function of
one variable.

46
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,806
And then, a lot of what we're interested
in

47
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:51,300
with Taylor's Formula is, I'm using this
to make

48
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,070
approximations of difficult functions
using polynomials, so a polynomial

49
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,396
is generally considered a pretty easy
function to work with.

50
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:02,523
you know, highly non-linear functions,
like sin of x times z

51
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:05,532
to the x, or something like that, would
not be fun functions

52
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:06,340
to work with.

53
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,505
And what we'll be interested in is how
close

54
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:16,350
is this polynomial, my polynomial
approximation, to the actual function.

55
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,570
And one nice concept for sort of

56
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,230
understanding that is called the Big O
notation.

57
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,200
And so I'm going to go over that in
section seven.

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,610
Section eight, I'll go over the.

59
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,646
Taylor's formula, so the same thing I did

60
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:33,680
in section six, but now using functions of
several variables.

61
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,400
Then in section nine, I'll talk about a
Taylor series expansion.

62
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,745
So Taylor's formula is a polynomial, so

63
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:45,310
you could have a second order, Taylor
polynomial.

64
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,800
It's going to have a linear term and a
quadratic term.

65
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,320
If I had a third order Taylor polynomial,
it would

66
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,010
have a linear term, a quadratic term and a
cubic term.

67
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,560
Taylor series expansion is,

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,110
if I just take the limit.

69
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,598
So I take, you know, fourth order
polynomial, fifth order polynomial, n-th

70
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:05,230
order polynomial and then I take the limit
as n goes to infinity.

71
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,584
And so really what were interested in
there is does this Taylor series

72
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:16,160
expansion converge to the thing that I'm
trying to approximate or does it diverge?

73
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,650
And so we have a few results that are
going to answer that question.

74
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,802
And then I'm going to

75
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,178
finish up that section by talking about

76
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:26,680
Bond Convexity which is revisiting a
topic.

77
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,390
From the first set of lectures, where I
did bond duration, and

78
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,910
then used bond duration to make a linear
approximation of the yield curve.

79
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,910
With some of the, the tools we've learned
from Taylor's formula, we can

80
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:46,550
now extend that to have a, a second order,
so a quadratic term in the approximation.

81
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,470
And that quadratic term is called
convexity.
