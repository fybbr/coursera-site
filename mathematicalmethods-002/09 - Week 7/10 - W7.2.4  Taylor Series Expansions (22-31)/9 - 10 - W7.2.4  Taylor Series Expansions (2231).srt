1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,090
Now we'll look at something called Taylor
Series Expansions.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,670
So before I assumed that my function f was
differentiatiable

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,260
n times, so if I wanted to make order and

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,180
Taylor polynomial so for a linear
approximation I just needed

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,780
to assume that it was differentialable at
least one time.

6
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:28,852
most of the functions were going to
encounter are differentiable

7
00:00:28,852 --> 00:00:34,572
infinitely many times, and this means
there so, the key thing to notice

8
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:39,304
here is the function zero has a derivative
that's also zero.

9
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:41,449
So any polynomial is derivative,

10
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:44,042
defferentiable an infinite number of
times.

11
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:48,688
So if it's say x squared, I take the
derivative, I get 2x.

12
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:52,427
I take the derivative, I get two.
I take the derivative, I get zero.

13
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,077
And then I can just continually take

14
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:56,340
derivatives and I always have zero after
that.

15
00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:00,870
so it's, it's difficult.

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,740
I actually was trying to think up a
function that I could put on a quiz.

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,240
Or something that wouldn't, that would
look like a normal

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,960
function, and would not be differentiable
after a certain point.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,379
And I couldn't really come up with
anything that

20
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:18,570
was, was pretty easy so there They do
exist and

21
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,550
they do show up when you start making,
kind

22
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,905
of, more complicated types of functions,
for instance, these things

23
00:01:23,905 --> 00:01:27,140
that are defined as limits of other
functions.

24
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,612
But, for something you can write down,
generally, they're going

25
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:32,830
to have as many derivatives as you as you
want.

26
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,804
So I'm going to make something called a
Taylor series expansion.

27
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:41,269
So I'm going to use a notation t of x to

28
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:45,519
mean a Taylor serious expansion, and
that's just going to

29
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,239
be the limit as n goes to infinity of the

30
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,309
Taylor polynomial evaluated at x as n goes
to infinity.

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,328
And so what I mean by that is just, the
limit as

32
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:03,750
this, limit of this sum as the number of
terms gets, infinite.

33
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,298
And it turns out that a Taylor series is

34
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:12,630
a special case of something called a Power
series, so.

35
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,290
For a Taylor series, we know exactly what
the, the coefficients are.

36
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,490
They're determined by the function f that
I'm trying to approximate.

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,633
So, a Power series is just a coefficient a
sub k

38
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:26,268
[SOUND]

39
00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:31,810
times the quantity x minus a to the kth
power.

40
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,569
And if I look at my definition of the,

41
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:38,129
of the Taylor polynomial, it just tells me
that

42
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:44,390
a sub k has to equal the kth derivative of
f evaluated at a, divided by k factorial.

43
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,125
And then another little bit of notation
that

44
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,810
you're going to start seeing pretty often
is.

45
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,300
The limit as n goes to infinity of this
finite sum.

46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,108
So from k equals 0 up to n is going

47
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:04,750
to be written the sum from k equals 0 to
infinity.

48
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,290
So it's probably what you would have
guessed it would be anyways, but

49
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,840
the real definition of what's going on
here is this means the limit.

50
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,480
As n goes to infinity of the finite sum
from k equals 1 to n of this series.

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,528
So the Power series coefficients, a sub k,

52
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:27,536
when I'm talking about a Taylor series
expansion, are

53
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:30,288
just the kth derivative of the function
I'm trying

54
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:33,610
to approximate, evaluated at a, divided by
k factorial.

55
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,695
And the reason I want to show that the

56
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:40,100
Taylor series of expansion is a special
case

57
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,310
of Power series, is there a more general

58
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,300
results for convergence of power series,
so there's

59
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,290
convergence results for power series in
general, and

60
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,280
those, because of Taylor series, there's a
special

61
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,165
case of a power series, we can also

62
00:03:53,165 --> 00:03:56,260
use those convergence results for a Taylor
series.

63
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,180
So the important one, the most important
one,

64
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,660
I suppose, is something called the radius
of convergence.

65
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,217
And this is going to be a number capital R
greater than 0, and

66
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:15,309
I want to look at my Power series, and if
this sums up to

67
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:20,982
a finite number so when I write less than,
strictly less than infinity,

68
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:26,004
what I mean is that whatever is on the
less than side, so whatever

69
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:29,120
is over here is a finite real number.

70
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,760
And then I'm going to define S of x just
to be this

71
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,096
infinite sum and so if this is, if x, so x
here is in this

72
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:44,200
interval a minus R to a plus R, where R is
the radius of

73
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,830
the convergence, so it's giving me and
interval.

74
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,015
If I take any point

75
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:53,464
in that interval then when I make this

76
00:04:53,464 --> 00:04:56,629
infinite sum I'm going to get a finite
number.

77
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,986
So clearly, If we don't get a finite
number then

78
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:04,022
we really can't, you know it's not going
to be useful

79
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:07,718
for approximation because that's telling
me as I add more terms,

80
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:12,410
my approximation's just getting bigger,
and bigger, and bigger, and bigger.

81
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,442
So unless I know that f of x is equal to
infinity I, I don't

82
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:19,046
want to be trying to approximate with

83
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:22,660
something that's diverging as I add more
terms.

84
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,710
So, the, the whole idea is I want to be
able to add more terms

85
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,296
to my Taylor polynomial to get a

86
00:05:27,296 --> 00:05:30,440
better approximation, not to get a worse
approximation.

87
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,037
Let's see so, it also turns out that this
function

88
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:46,760
S of x, we can take derivatives of these
too.

89
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,460
So, I can take the derivative of this when
it's finite.

90
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,770
And then S of x we're going to say is not
defined.

91
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,350
So, if I'm outside of the radius of

92
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:06,160
convergence, then I don't know what
happens to S.

93
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,600
It, it goes to a infinity.

94
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,264
So, I'm not really going to make, be

95
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:11,920
able to make any meaningful statement
about its property.

96
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,705
It's like I certainly couldn't define a

97
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:16,910
derivative For something that's equal to
infinity everywhere.

98
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,560
And so this is the convergence property
that comes from Power series

99
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,260
that I want to also be able to use for
Taylor series.

100
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:36,830
So it turns out, I need, it's, it's going
to depend on These coefficients a sub k.

101
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,030
But if the limit as k goes to infinity.

102
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,208
So I just need to look at these
coefficients a sub k absolute

103
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,950
value, to the one over kth power.

104
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:57,090
So this is the same thing as taking the
kth root Of the absolute value of a sub k.

105
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,610
So if it was one half, that would be the
square root.

106
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,260
If it was one third, that would be the
cube root.

107
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,970
If it was one over four, that would be the
fourth root.

108
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,440
And so on.

109
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:13,006
So if you can make sense of that limit, if
that's a finite value, then I

110
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:18,010
can define the radius of convergence to be
one divided by that limit.

111
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:24,125
And now for our Taylor series expansion,

112
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:28,610
I know what these a sub k's have to be.

113
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:37,723
And you can use a property so the sort of
annoying thing is that a sub k has this

114
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:41,545
k factorial in it and sometimes that's
going to be

115
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:45,420
a pain to try and deal with in the limit.

116
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,389
So luckily somebody proved this additional
theorem where

117
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:52,100
instead of k factorial, I just have k.

118
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,390
And so if this limit so it's k divided by.

119
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,276
This is the kth derivative of f evaluated
at a

120
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:03,318
and then I take the absolute value of that
to the

121
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:05,970
one over kth power so it looks kind of
like

122
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,730
this, except I don't have this k factorial
in there anymore.

123
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,260
So, somehow the k factorial.

124
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,588
To the 1 over k has become this k, up in

125
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:22,660
the, just this k to with no factorial up
in the numerator.

126
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,108
So if this limit exists, then the radius
of

127
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:27,964
convergence, so this is for a Taylor
series now,

128
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:31,364
because I'm defining these coefficients in
terms of the,

129
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:35,170
the derivatives that I'm using to build my
Taylor polynomials.

130
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,710
The radius of convergence is 1 divided by
e times the value of that limit.

131
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:54,455
And so far, what we've been able to show
then is that T of x is a finite number so

132
00:08:54,455 --> 00:09:00,070
that, that's a good first step but it's
still not doing what we want to do.

133
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:05,650
What we really want to be able to do is to
use T of x, or, or a polynomial

134
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:10,869
that we would build on the way to T of x
to approximate our function f.

135
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,942
So if T of x is at least a finite

136
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:16,494
number, you know, we're doing a lot better
than if

137
00:09:16,494 --> 00:09:20,010
it was infinite, there's still the
possibility that it would work.

138
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,600
But what we'd really like to know is if or
where T of x is equal to

139
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,130
f of x, because if T of x, so if this
infinite sum is converging

140
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,630
To f of x at a point x, then the idea
would be that I can use some

141
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:44,160
of those terms to make an approximation of
f at that point x.

142
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,810
So we have a, another theorem.

143
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,020
And this is, this one's a little bit
trickier.

144
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,708
So we need to know what the radius of
convergence is

145
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:59,320
and we can get that from the formula on
the previous slide.

146
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,900
So you can use either the formula for the
Power series in general.

147
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,360
Or you can use the special case for the
Taylor's expansion.

148
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,559
And you, sometimes it's actually easier to
use the general

149
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,158
formula even when you're working with the
Taylor expansion just to, it

150
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:19,495
depends on whether when you want this k
factorial in there or not.

151
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:20,005
[COUGH]

152
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:25,105
Then once you know what the radius of
convergence is, so you

153
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:30,220
know for what values of x is T of x going
to at least be finite?

154
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,600
We can look at this limit.

155
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,031
So I need to take R to the k, so this is
some number that's

156
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:43,110
going to be inside the, it's going to be
smaller than the radius of convergence.

157
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,300
So I take R to the kth power, divided by k
factorial.

158
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,220
And then I have to look at the kth
derivative of f.

159
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:02,830
Evaluated at a point z, that's in between
a minus r and a plus r.

160
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:07,720
So I'm making an interval around a of
width lower case r.

161
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,060
And I need to find the maximum value of
the kth derivative on that interval.

162
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,590
So, once you're done doing this part, that
should just be a number.

163
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,970
So it's the maximum value of this
derivative on

164
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,370
this interval so, but it might involve
this number r.

165
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:35,110
And then I'm going to look at that, this
limit as k goes to infinity.

166
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,730
If that limit is equal to 0, then T of x
is equal to f of x.

167
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,859
And so what that's going to tell me is
that every x.

168
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:54,510
That's within r, of my point a, has the
property that the Taylor series expansion.

169
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,740
So if I just make this infinitely long
Taylor polynomial.

170
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,529
That's going to be exactly equal to the
function that I'm trying to approximate.

171
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,250
So let me work through a quick example of
this.

172
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,862
So the Taylor series expansion for the
function f of

173
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:16,634
x equals log of 1 plus x around the point

174
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:18,986
a equals 0 is going to be, so I can

175
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:22,900
either define this just with k equals 0 to
infinity.

176
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,820
Or I can think about making Taylor
polynomials of order n and then taking

177
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,248
the limit as n goes to infinity, either
one of these they mean the

178
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:36,676
same thing, they're just two different
ways of communicating

179
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:40,572
this same idea.
But the one on the right hand side is sort

180
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:47,410
of the more precise of the two.
So I'm just going to take x minus a.

181
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,970
But here, I've said I want to make the
expansion around the point 0.

182
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:57,425
So that's going to be x minus 0 to the kth
power, divided by k factorial, times f k,

183
00:12:57,425 --> 00:13:03,097
so the kth derivative of my function f
evaluated at the point 0.

184
00:13:03,097 --> 00:13:08,281
So it turns out, if I, if I have log of 1
plus x, the first

185
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:13,465
derivative of that is just going to be 1
divided by 1 plus

186
00:13:13,465 --> 00:13:18,250
x, so I can write that as 1 plus x to the
negative 1.

187
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,468
And if I were to take another derivative
of that, I'd have negative

188
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,390
1 times 1 plus x to the negative 2.

189
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,658
If I took another derivative of that I
would

190
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:31,190
have negative three times whatever
coefficient I have out here.

191
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,040
And because every time I take a derivative
I'm getting a negative sign.

192
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:39,880
the sign of each one of these derivatives
is going to be alternating.

193
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,200
So the way I'm going to capture that is
just put a minus one To a power.

194
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,510
And then I just choose this power so that

195
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,860
it's even when I want a positive term and
odd when I want a negative term.

196
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,745
So the first derivative, when I have one
prime here,

197
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:03,260
those are the ones that I want to be
positive.

198
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,036
So when I have an odd derivative, so first
derivative, third derivative,

199
00:14:07,036 --> 00:14:10,970
fifth derivative and so on, I want to have
a positive expression.

200
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,256
So I'm just going to put k plus 1 as my
power on the negative 1,

201
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:16,240
and that's going to take care of the flip

202
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,640
flopping sign as the, as the sum goes
along.

203
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,420
And then, every time I take a derivative,
I'm going to get 1

204
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,270
and then a two and then a three and then a
four.

205
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,026
But, because the first derivative I got
from

206
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:35,440
log I'm actually one behind in my count.

207
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,510
So I end up with k minus 1 factorial as my
coeefiecient here.

208
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,650
And then I have 1 plus x to the minus k.

209
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,930
So when I take the first derivative, I
have a minus 1.

210
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,260
The second derivitive would have a minus 2
and so on.

211
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,678
And so this is what I want to plug in

212
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:57,110
to this term right here, and I'm going to
evaluate.

213
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:02,297
So this is the kth derivitive at x I
want to evaluate the kth derivative

214
00:15:02,297 --> 00:15:06,210
at the point 0, so when I put in 0 in this
part of the

215
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:11,397
expression here, this is the only part
that actually has an x in it,

216
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:16,766
I'm going to get 1 plus 0 to the minus kth
power, and that's just going to

217
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:22,750
be 1 to the minus kth power.
And 1 to any power is equal to 1.

218
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,742
So when I evaluate this at 0, this final

219
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:29,500
part of the expression is just going to
drop away.

220
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,370
So I end up with just this alternating
sign.

221
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,948
And then a k minus 1 factorial, for my fk
of 0 derivatives,

222
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:49,564
and now, when I plug this back into my
Taylor expansion, what

223
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:54,964
I end up getting is x minus 0 to the k, so
that just going to

224
00:15:54,964 --> 00:16:00,148
be an x to the k in the numerator I have a
k factorial and then

225
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:05,548
this expression fk of 0 that we just
worked out over here and

226
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:10,538
this has a k minus one factorial in it.
So the k minus one

227
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:15,480
factorial time, divided by k factorial is
just going to give me.

228
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,170
Why can't I select you?

229
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,520
Okay I'm not going to try that anymore.

230
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,640
It's just going to give me this factor of
k in the denominator.

231
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,780
So that's k minus one factorial divided by
k factorial.

232
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,020
Everything cancels itself out except for
the k.

233
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,332
So I divide by k In the numerator, I have
x to

234
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:42,430
the k which came from this x minus 0 to
the kth power.

235
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,450
And then I have this flip flopping

236
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,210
sine term.

237
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,990
So it turns out that my Taylor series
expansion is going to

238
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,670
be x minus x squared over two plus x cubed
over three.

239
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,100
Minus x to the 4th over 4 and so on.

240
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,960
And so now I want to find the radius of
convergence of that.

241
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,451
And so first I'll try, because this is a
Taylor series expansion,

242
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:13,540
I'll try using the formula we had for the
Taylor series expansion.

243
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,390
So I had the.

244
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,500
Fk evaluated at the point a.

245
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,400
So my point a was 0, so I have an
expression for that.

246
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,313
But now I have this k minus 1 factorial to
the 1 over

247
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:31,100
kth power in the denominator, and I have a
k in the numerator.

248
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,129
And so I don't really know how to make
sense out of that limit.

249
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,830
So, I said, hmh.

250
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,000
But I have another possibility.

251
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,925
Because this is a special case of a Power
series, I can

252
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:46,060
go back and try the formula for the power
series as well.

253
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,374
And so that said that if the limit of
these coefficients

254
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:56,820
existed, then the radius of convergence
would be one over this limit.

255
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,452
So let's

256
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,060
see what happens if I just plug this in.

257
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,710
So I have minus one to the k plus

258
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,100
one divided by k as my sequence of
coefficients.

259
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,125
And when I take the absolute value of
that, the whole numerator's just going to

260
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:17,156
go away.
So what I end up with is the limit As k

261
00:18:17,156 --> 00:18:22,796
goes to infinity of 1 over k to the one
over kth power, and so notice that

262
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:28,070
the power is exactly equal to the thing
that I am taking the power.

263
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,452
So I'm going to say this is equal to the
limit as u of u to the

264
00:18:33,452 --> 00:18:38,717
uth power, and if one over k if k is going
to infinity,

265
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:43,820
then 1 over k is going to 0.
So I can just say, this

266
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,990
is the limit as u goes down to 0 of u to
the uth power.

267
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,159
And if you go back to our lectures on
limits, this

268
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:56,059
was one of the things that we said was
equal to 1.

269
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:02,590
So if this limit is equal to 1, the radius
of convergence is 1 divided by that.

270
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,920
So that tells me that the radius of
convergence is equal to 1.

271
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,128
And then the last thing we have to do is

272
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:19,320
see if Or where t of x is equal to the log
of one plus x.

273
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,030
So this is my function f of x.

274
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,030
So I know that the radius of convergence
is equal to one.

275
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,960
So I'm looking for some number r that's
between 0.

276
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,346
So some number little r that's in between
0 and one

277
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:41,038
and so again, I'm just going to use the
theorem that I had

278
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,608
on a few slides ago, and that said that if
I

279
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:50,524
looked at this derivative, but now instead
of being able to evaluate

280
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:55,522
z it at the point 0, I have to evaluate it
at the point, and

281
00:19:55,522 --> 00:20:00,590
find out where it's maximum on the
interval minus r to r.

282
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,340
And what I end up having here is minus 1
to the n plus 1.

283
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,790
So my absolute value is going to take care
of this flip-flopping sign for me.

284
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:17,829
I have an n minus 1 factorial in the
numerator and then a 1 plus z to the nth

285
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:23,769
power in the denominator and I'm trying to
make this as big as I possibly

286
00:20:23,769 --> 00:20:29,426
can.
So I want to make the denominator

287
00:20:29,426 --> 00:20:33,500
as small as I possibly can.

288
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,170
So the smallest I can make this is if I
take one minus r

289
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,748
And so that gives me is that

290
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:53,161
right?
I must have

291
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:59,027
had a missing one

292
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:04,490
line in here.

293
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:07,056
For what I should do.
but essentially

294
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:10,752
because r, I can't actually make this
denominator 0,

295
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:13,530
because r has to be strictly less than 1.

296
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,138
And so what I end up with is, I have
something

297
00:21:17,138 --> 00:21:21,180
to the n down here, and this r to the n
here.

298
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,491
And that actually gives, I can think of
that as then

299
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,478
just r times 1, or, r divided by 1 minus
r.

300
00:21:27,478 --> 00:21:31,824
To the nth power but I'm taking the limit
as n goes to infinity,

301
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:35,690
and so r divided by 1 minus r, that's just
a constant.

302
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,136
And I have, so I have some constant to the
nth power divided by n

303
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:46,820
factorial, and that limit is again one of
the results we had from the first week.

304
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,053
That any constant to a power divided by n
factorial, if I take

305
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:55,120
the limit of that as n goes to infinity,
I'm going to get 0.

306
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,682
And so that tells me, I can make r as
close as I want

307
00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:06,540
to capital R but I can not actually make
it equal to capital R.

308
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,875
So it's just turned this sort of open
interval, this radius

309
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:15,720
of convergence of being 1 it goes, it's a
closed interval its

310
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,865
now an open interval so our little r can
be any

311
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:23,370
number if it's smaller than 1 but it can't
actually be 1.

312
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,770
And so that tells me that T of x is equal
to f

313
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:31,173
of x as long as the absolute value of x is
less than 1.
