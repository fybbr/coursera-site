00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,607
Welcome to week 8, the 8th and

2
00:00:02,607 --> 00:00:06,950
final week of Mathematical Methods for
Quantitative Finance.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,660
This week, I'm going to talk about
numerical methods.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,054
So, so far in the course, I've introduced
a

5
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:15,390
lot of topics for solving different types
of the problems.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,424
But a lot of the examples in the homework
have been

7
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:21,820
what, what I sort of think of as sort of
toy examples.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,550
Because they need to be complicated enough
that you understand what's going on.

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,014
At the same time they need to be simple
enough that you

10
00:00:29,014 --> 00:00:31,720
can actually solve them with a, pen and a
piece of paper.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,629
In practice though, we're going to want to
solve much more complicated problems.

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,280
And so to do that we, we're going to want
to do that with a computer.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,070
And so that brings us to this topic of
numerical methods.

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:54,370
So the outline for this week, I'll talk
about a problem called Implied Volatility.

15
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,122
So this is basically going back to the
Black-Sholes pricing formula.

16
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:02,482
But instead of thinking of the, the value
that I

17
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:06,467
want to calculate as the call price or the
put price.

18
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:09,347
I'm going to think that I could actually
go,

19
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:12,810
or I'm going to approach the problem in
this sense.

20
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,007
I can actually go to the

21
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:18,560
market and I can observe all of the inputs
for the Black-Sholes formula.

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,470
And I can see what that put or call price
actually is.

23
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,255
And the one thing that's going to be the
most

24
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:28,780
difficult to observe is the volatility
parameter, the sigma.

25
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,525
And so, given that I have the price, I can
actually use Black-sholes kind of

26
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:39,450
backwards to figure out what the sigma
parameter had to be to justify that price.

27
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,380
And that turns out to involve solving
something called a non linear equation.

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,839
And so then in sections two and three, I'm
going to

29
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:51,947
consider two methods for solving non
linear equations, the Bisection method.

30
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:55,242
So essentially what I'm trying to do with
the Bisection method.

31
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:58,954
So I want to find two endpoints so that I
know I'm bigger than the value I

32
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:03,560
want on one side, and I'm smaller than the
value I want on the other side.

33
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,290
And then, I'm going to just start chopping
that interval in half.

34
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,930
By preserving this property that the, the
right end point and

35
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,360
the left end point bracket the point that
I'm looking for.

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,757
And so, as I chop this in half, you know,
the end points

37
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:20,629
are getting closer and closer to the
number that I want to compute.

38
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,000
Another approach for solving this is
called Newton's method.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,488
So this has a little bit stronger
assumptions that I need

40
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:34,600
the function I'm trying to find the value
of to be differentiable.

41
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,906
And then the other nice property that
Newton's Method

42
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:42,150
has is there's a n dimensional version of
Newton's Method.

43
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,762
So the, the bisection method is only

44
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:45,650
going to work if there's a single
variable.

45
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,246
It get, it starts to break down if I'm, if
there's

46
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:51,030
a variable going this way and a variable
going this way.

47
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,165
And so once I've gone over how I can

48
00:02:56,165 --> 00:03:00,190
solve these nonlinear problems using
Newton's method and bisection.

49
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,680
Then I'm going to look at some of the
problems we had from last week's lecture.

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,340
So in particular, the problems that came
up using Lagrange's method.

51
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,176
We're going to have generally a non linear
system that we

52
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:16,826
need to solve to find the critical point
of the Lagrange

53
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:17,585
[UNKNOWN].

54
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:20,196
And so we can use Newton's method do that.

55
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:23,008
So I'll talk about about how you can set
that

56
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,780
problem up in section 5 and go through a
small example.

57
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,680
And then in section 6, I'm going to go
through another example of that.

58
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,599
And then finally in section 7, I'm going
to look at the other optimal

59
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,226
investment portfolio that I talked about
in

60
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:42,470
week 7 called the maximum expected returns
portfolio.

61
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,730
And so this ends up being a

62
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,823
bit more complicated than the minimum
variance portfolio.

63
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:48,679
But it's something that can be solved

64
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:51,800
using the n dimensional version of
Newton's method.

65
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,990
And so I have a example of how that can be
done.
