1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,270
So, we're finally arriving at week number
eight

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,960
where I'm going to talk about numerical
methods.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,730
So I think it's you know, when we looked
at the Lagrange

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,480
multipliers, we started to arrive at
things where they were getting just.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,250
You could still solve them in special
cases.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,780
for instance, when we looked at the
minimum, minimum variance portfolio.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,570
It was still possible to, where we ended
up like the linear system,

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,790
we need to dissolve to do the Lagrange
multipliers.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,700
here to find the critical point for the

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,155
Lagrange multiplier, the critical point
for the Lagrangian.

11
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:37,850
[COUGH]

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,870
But pretty much anything beyond that, any
anything that is not sort of

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,570
contrived to be simple is going to be far
too difficult to solve.

14
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,200
And so that's why we have something called
the numerical methods.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,720
Which I sort of think of as just the
logical extension

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,430
of the guess and check method that I
learned in elementary school.

17
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,700
So you basically are just trying to make a
guess.

18
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,940
You'll measure how

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,830
wrong you are, and that will hopefully
suggest

20
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,000
a way for you to improve your guess.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,160
And you want to do that in a way where you

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,270
find the answer you're looking for with a
minimum amount of work.

23
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,360
So the motivation for this, I'm, I'm

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,760
going to look at a problem called implied
volatility.

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,490
And then I'll talk about two methods for
solving that.

26
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,060
So one is bisection method, which is just
a

27
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,750
very easy approach to solving this implied
volatility problem.

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,090
Then Newton's method, which is not much
more difficult, but theoretically

29
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,950
it's a bit more, it, it has some
theoretical, some nice theoretical

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,290
results we can, we can look at.

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,430
Now, also the nice thing about Newton's
method

32
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,409
is it can be extended for N dimensional
problems.

33
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,570
And then finally, and I don't know if
we'll have time to get to this today.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,110
we'll look at solving a problem with
Lagrange method, so it's actually

35
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,990
one of the same problems I looked at in
the Lagrange slides.

36
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,960
But instead of just trying to do algebra
once I need to find

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,250
the critical point, I'll use Newton's
method to try and find the critical point.

38
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,130
So we get started by talking about implied
volatility.

39
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:25,820
So if we remember from the first half of
the course, we were looking at the,

40
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,090
the Black-Scholes formula for a while, and
mostly

41
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,259
when we were looking at computing partial
derivatives.

42
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,420
And so, this is just to remind you what it

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,570
is, and hopefully I haven't made any, any
typos in it.

44
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,170
And if you look, well, I think I've got
all of the,

45
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,240
so the maturity, so the, the maturity date
of an option, this is

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,380
a, a contract that I go and buy and sell
in a market.

47
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,730
And when it's written, it's going to have
a maturity date.

48
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,210
So, it's good for 3 months or it's good
for 6 months.

49
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:00,940
Something like that.

50
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,510
It has something called the strike price,
which is, this

51
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,220
is also something going to be written on
the contract.

52
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,030
So basically, once this contract comes

53
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:17,150
into existence, the T Oops, and the K are
fixed, so they're never going to change.

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,330
And then there's a secondary market for
these contracts.

55
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,150
So once I have the contract, if it's
between the time that it was written

56
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,050
and the maturity, I can go to the
secondary market and I can sell my option.

57
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,410
So I don't actually have to wait for the
condition in the auction to come to pass.

58
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,210
I can go and find somebody else who's
interested in having that

59
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,140
same type of protection and I can sell my
option to him.

60
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,380
And so if I

61
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:53,780
sell the option, at the time that I sell
the option the price that I sell it for

62
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,670
is going to be known, because you know, I

63
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,770
give him the contract, he gives me some
money.

64
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,900
So I can look at the amount of money he
gave me

65
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,840
and, and I know exactly what the price of
that option is.

66
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,660
The option is based on some underlying
asset that has a,

67
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,680
a price S, and so I can also look in the
market

68
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,160
at the same time that I sold my option for
this price C.

69
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,240
I can look at the most recent trade for

70
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,870
that underlying assett and see what the
asset price is.

71
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,480
So, I can also assume that when these
transactions take

72
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,280
place, the C and the S are going to be
known.

73
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,760
And then I'm also going to assume that the

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,600
risk free rate is constant, and that the
dividend rate.

75
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,980
So, because options exist on kind of a
short time scale

76
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,500
most of the time, you know either 3 months
or 6 months.

77
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,900
You generally know what the, the company's
already

78
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,930
announced when it's going to be paying
dividends.

79
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,290
So you know if you're going to get

80
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,030
dividends during the life of the option or
not.

81
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,110
And the risk free risk, well, it's
definitely changing.

82
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,230
It changes on a very slow time scale.

83
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,130
So on the, during the life of the option,
you can assume that that's fixed.

84
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:12,641
And so it turns that if you look in this
formula, so it depends on this d1 and d2

85
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:18,700
as well, you know everything except this
variable sigma.

86
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,160
So the, the only quantity that's not known
is the volatility, and

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,110
this is the one thing that it's actually
quite difficult to know,

88
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,970
that there's not any one thing in the
market where you can

89
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,585
just say oh, this is, this is definitely
the rate of sigma.

90
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:39,850
So going in the, in the forward sense when
you want to use sigma as

91
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,050
an input to this formula, it's something
you have to actually estimate from data.

92
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,040
So you have to look at, it's, it's trying
to describe the, how how

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,680
wide the fluctuations are of this
underlying asset price S.

94
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,595
And so it's, you can estimate it, but you
can never actually know it.

95
00:05:57,595 --> 00:06:02,640
Whereas if you go to the market you know,
on a particular day, I can see what was

96
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,630
you know, what when that asset changed
hands, what

97
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,030
were those prices so I can actually
observe S.

98
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,070
Sigma, I'm not able to do that in any way.

99
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,240
So the implied volatility problem.

100
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,250
If I know every variable and the answer to
the Black-Scholes pricing formula except

101
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,950
sigma, then what I want to do is just sort
of solve this equation backwards.

102
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,320
So, essentially, if I could, I'd like to
isolate sigma and

103
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,440
have a new functions that's sigma as a
function of everything else.

104
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,010
But it turns out, if, if we look at this
guy, it's not exactly easy to do that.

105
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,010
So extra credit if anybody can come up
with the formula.

106
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,230
And so what I want to do, as this is

107
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,530
where I was getting at this trial and
error thing.

108
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,425
I want to just plug in values of sigma
into my

109
00:06:57,425 --> 00:07:01,410
Black-Scholes formula, and I know what the
call price should be.

110
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,260
And for every different value of sigma
that

111
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,040
I plug in, I'm going to get some price.

112
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,690
And eventually, if I just keep guessing
long enough, I'm going to get a value of

113
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,820
sigma that gets me very close to the price
that I know it should, should be.

114
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,150
So I,

115
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,770
if I can get close to that market price C,
then that's

116
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,040
probably, well, I mean, that's the, the
value of sigma that would

117
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,858
have been in the market.
And so even though I can't observe sigma,

118
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:30,560
all the other things that I can observe
imply a certain level for sigma.

119
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:39,200
They imply a certain amount sigma, and so
that's going to be called the

120
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,992
implied volatility.

121
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:47,262
So what I want to look at is, is if, if S,
K, Q, R, T and little t.

122
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:50,034
So this is basically all of the inputs to
the

123
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:54,885
Black-Scholes pricing formula for our
European call option are known and

124
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:57,734
I also know what the price of that option
is,

125
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:00,799
then I can think of this as a function of
sigma.

126
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:04,735
So there's only one unknown in this
highlighted

127
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:09,816
side of the equation and that's sigma.
And the way I've set

128
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:14,713
this up, I've, I've, put the theoretical
price for European call

129
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:19,981
option minus the price for that option
that I've observed in the market.

130
00:08:19,981 --> 00:08:25,129
So when I have the correct value of sigma,
this

131
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:30,014
whole thing f of sigma should be equal to
0.

132
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:34,118
So finding the implied volatility really
just boils down to solving

133
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:38,392
this thing, it, it's called a non-linear
optimization problem.

134
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:46,549
And I just want to find the value of sigma
so that f of sigma is equal to zero.

135
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:50,749
And this is something like I said you're
not going to be able to just

136
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:55,024
isolate sigma and have a nice f of sigma
function you can just plug in a

137
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:58,538
zero and find out what should it have
been.

138
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,350
so you have to solve this numerically.

139
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,292
And so when I say, solve numerically,
there, there are lots of

140
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:10,864
different prices, lots of different ways I
can try and do this.

141
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:15,679
So, the, the simplest one would just be to
make a plot

142
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,961
of f of sigma and see where it crosses the
x axis.

143
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:23,174
And so, where it crosses the x axis is
where f of sigma is going

144
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:27,171
to be equal to 0, and that's what I'm
trying to find in the, the value.

145
00:09:27,171 --> 00:09:30,755
So, the x axis in this case is going to be
the sigma axis.

146
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:36,663
The value of sigma where it crosses the
axis is this f of sigma equals 0.

147
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,785
And so, to do that in R, the first thing I
need is a function to compute the

148
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:48,940
Black-Scholes call price.
So, this is just our implementation of

149
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,840
what was on the slide, a couple of slides
ago, so I've made an expression for d1.

150
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,990
Then the expression for d2, and then
finally the expression

151
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:08,060
for the Black-Scholes call price.

152
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,800
And I, I don't know if you guys are
getting used to looking at r

153
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,400
yet, but basically what I'm doing here is
I've I'm taking this expression,

154
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,020
I'm assigning it to a piece of memory, a
variable called d1.

155
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,420
Then I'm taking this expression, assigning
it to

156
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,290
a piece of memory, a variable called d2.

157
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,440
But then in R, if the last expression in a
function.

158
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,330
So, because this has this keyword function
here, this thing

159
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:43,780
is a function, the last expression in a
function gets returned.

160
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,140
So, when I evaluate this, I don't have to,
you can if you want to

161
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,650
say you know, assign this to say
Black-Scholes call price and

162
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,560
then have one more line that says return
Black-Scholes call price.

163
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,850
Or you can just put an expression for the
thing

164
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,110
that you want your function to return as
the last line.

165
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,770
So that's why this is going to work.

166
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,570
And then one of the nice features R has is
it's treating every

167
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,840
variable like a vector.
So, instead of having to do this in a for

168
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,430
loop, or evaluate the function by hand you
know, 50 or 60 times to get a set of

169
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:30,050
points to, to plot, I can just give I can
give a vector argument.

170
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,358
So right now I'm giving every argument
that's just a

171
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:36,860
length one vector.
And so I get a length one answer.

172
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,540
On the other hand, suppose I take, so the
second to last thing, this little s so.

173
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,000
I, I guess I should also mention this is
sort of

174
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,969
bad bad programming, because none of the
variables have very meaningful names.

175
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,670
I just had to do that to make it fit on
the slide, the

176
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,170
first way, I wrote this only about the
first half of it on the slide.

177
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,970
I also think it's a lot easier to read

178
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,044
if you know, when I say something like R
minus

179
00:12:05,044 --> 00:12:08,080
Q, that should be R space minus space Q.

180
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,094
you want to group things, so it's a little
bit easier to see what the function is.

181
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:17,940
But in this particular case I had a
another constraint which it needed to

182
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,900
fit up here for the, for the lecture, so I
had to skip that.

183
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,360
But if we look at the second to last
argument, this lower

184
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,715
case s, this is where I'm putting in my
value of sigma.

185
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,613
And so, when I call my function

186
00:12:30,613 --> 00:12:33,533
this time, instead of putting in a single
value

187
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:36,798
for sigma, I'm putting in three values for
sigma.

188
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:42,512
I want to end that getting out are three
values for this Black-Scholes call price.

189
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:48,947
So all of the other variables stay the
same, but the first one here

190
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:55,616
corresponds to sigma of 0.15, the second
one here corresponds

191
00:12:55,616 --> 00:13:02,798
to sigma of 0.2, and the third one
corresponds to sigma of 0.25.

192
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:08,334
And now, let's suppose that the option
sold for $7, and I want to find sigma.

193
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:10,746
So you can think of this is, I want to
find the

194
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:14,761
sigma that's going to make my
Black-Scholes call price equal to 7.

195
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:18,067
But most nonlinear solvers are going to be
set

196
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:21,445
up just to solve this f of whatever equals
0.

197
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:23,545
So you want to make a new objective

198
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:26,900
function where the point you're looking
for is 0.

199
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,400
And

200
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,140
I'm going to call that function f of
sigma.

201
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,343
And that's just going to be my
Black-Scholes call price minus 7.

202
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,620
And I'm going to plot that over a range of
values

203
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,790
of sigma and see where it crosses the x
axis.

204
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,850
So the first thing I'll do is make my
range of sigmas.

205
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,870
So seq is a function that just makes a
sequence.

206
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,954
It starts at 0.05.

207
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:54,427
It's going to end at 0.5.

208
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:01,926
And it's going to go in steps of 0.01.

209
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:06,510
Then f sig, I'm going

210
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:11,010
to evaluate my Black-Scholes call price,
add all of

211
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,870
the inputs that were fixed, and then at
this entire vector of sigmas.

212
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:21,580
So this is, I think this will end up being
maybe 46 different values of sigma.

213
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,620
So, this is going to give me 46 different
Black-Scholes call prices corresponding to

214
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:32,460
each one of those input sigmas, and then
I'm going to subtract seven from that.

215
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,770
And hopefully, one of these will be pretty
close to zero.

216
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,670
And then I'm going to plot.
So, I'll put sigma on the x axis, and

217
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:47,190
then this fsig that I've just calculated
here on the y axis, and then this optional

218
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,010
arguments type equals l.

219
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,800
It's just going to plot it with a line
rather than

220
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,589
with points, and I get a plot that looks
like this.

221
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,420
And so, on the, on the left here, I'm
below 0, on the right I'm about 0.

222
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:07,520
And it looks like about sigma equals 0.25
is about where I hit 0.

223
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,470
So that gives me an implied volatility,

224
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,560
so I denoted that.
Sigma sub implied, think the book is

225
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:23,050
called Sigma sub imp of 0.25.

226
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:29,490
And so, this is a valid way of coming up
with an implied volatility.

227
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,500
But to do that, I had to evaluate the
Black-Scholes formula 46 times.

228
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,450
And now if you look at this plot, you
know, I evaluated

229
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,520
a whole lot over here where it wasn't
telling me very much.

230
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,460
And I did the same thing over here.

231
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,910
And still the computer answer was not very
precise.

232
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:53,312
So I, I only plotted it in these steps of
0.01.

233
00:15:53,312 --> 00:16:00,620
And so it turned out that 0.25 was
slightly less than 0.

234
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,910
And when I put in 0.26, it was slightly
more, but it

235
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,750
was more slightly more so that 0.25 was
the closest one to 0.

236
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,750
So that's

237
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:16,580
why I picked this one.
And so I was off by, so this,

238
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,970
this is on the scale of dollars here, so I
was off by about one and a half cents.

239
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,210
So it's, doesn't sound too bad, except
that

240
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,370
you might be trading, you know, thousands
or tens

241
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,230
of thousands of these things, and so that,
that

242
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,490
ends up being more worrisome to be off by.

243
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,700
So what I'd really like to be able to do

244
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:44,720
is compute this implied volatility to
within a pre-specified tolerance.

245
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,140
So right now, I've, I've just sort of done
these 46 things, and I've ended

246
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,780
up finding out how close I was just by
going back and checking my solution.

247
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:59,349
What I would like to have is an algorithm
that's going to keep going until.

248
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:03,210
So for instance, I was just going to buy
one option, I

249
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,890
would sort of want this to keep going
until maybe the first significant

250
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,010
digit was somewhere over here, and then I
would be certain that

251
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,720
I'm within less than a penny of the price
that I'm aiming for.

252
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,340
And so, if I only wanted to buy one.

253
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,630
Well, if that's the smallest denomination
of currency bill

254
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,750
allowed me to use, then that will be good
enough.

255
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,650
So I want to get inside this pre-specified
color, and at the same time

256
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,330
to do that, I want to use the minimum
number of function evaluations required.

257
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,020
And so the methods, the, the general
methods for

258
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,186
solving this type of problem are called
nonlinear solvers.
