1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,270
I'll get started, then, with transposes
and permutations.

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,761
So let's let A by an M by N matrix.
So, this is a matrix

3
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:21,860
with M rows, and N columns.
And then I'm going to.

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,610
Introduce an operation called the
transpose.

5
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,754
So the transpose of A is just going to be

6
00:00:26,754 --> 00:00:29,320
denoted by A with a little T in the
subscript.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,540
So, you know, just like A squared this is
A transpose.

8
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:40,360
And that just means so the transpose
operation just puts the columns

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,510
So the columns of A transposed are the
rows of A, so the

10
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,430
first row of A becomes the first column of
A transposed, the second

11
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,050
row of A becomes the second column of A
transposed and so on.

12
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,810
And if you think about it in terms of the
the

13
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:00,310
elements so a matrix A has elements that
are little a,

14
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,750
sub i j.

15
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:08,360
In the transpose those would just be a sub
j i so I'm just swapping the indeces.

16
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,207
And so if I do that if the dimension of my
matrix a is m by n then if

17
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:21,251
I swap the row and the columns, the
dimension of a transpose is

18
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:26,510
going to be n by m.
So here I had n columns.

19
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,060
They become the n rows of a transpose.

20
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,141
And just, I mean it's a, it's a pretty
obvious thing to do, if I have

21
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:42,140
a as just one, two, three, four, five, six
so the first row is one, two, three.

22
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,900
And the first column of A transpose is
one, two, three.

23
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,560
And when A is not square, not that the
dimension changes too.

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,670
So it goes from being a two by three
matrix.

25
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,450
So A has two rows and three columns.

26
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,440
A transpose then has three rows and two
columns.

27
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,185
And so some properties of the transpose,

28
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:07,310
the first one, hope everybody agrees with
this.

29
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:12,630
So if I take A transpose and transpose it
again, I just get A back.

30
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:22,518
If I have a

31
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:29,907
transpose

32
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:36,475
of a sum,

33
00:02:36,475 --> 00:02:42,222
so I have

34
00:02:42,222 --> 00:02:47,148
A plus B

35
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:56,179
transpose,

36
00:02:56,179 --> 00:03:00,284
thats

37
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:07,673
just going

38
00:03:07,673 --> 00:03:16,704
to be equal to

39
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:24,093
[INAUDIBLE]

40
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:30,661
it's not

41
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:38,050
letting me

42
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:45,439
highlight

43
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:51,186
there,

44
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:55,291
has to

45
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:59,396
be the

46
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:04,322
same as

47
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:10,890
whatever

48
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,637
is in the

49
00:04:16,637 --> 00:04:26,489
3 1 position

50
00:04:26,489 --> 00:04:30,594
and in

51
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:34,699
the,

52
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:38,804
the 4

53
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:43,730
is here

54
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:48,656
have to

55
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:55,224
be same,

56
00:04:55,224 --> 00:05:00,150
so that

57
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,255
would

58
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:09,181
be 3 2

59
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:15,749
position

60
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:19,854
has to

61
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:23,959
be the

62
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,885
same as

63
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:34,632
the 2 3

64
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:42,272
position So

65
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:46,880
here I have a and a transposed being the
same thing, so this is a symmetric matrix.

66
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,630
And then an even more special case of
symmetric matrices is a diagonal matrix.

67
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:03,630
And so a matrix is diagonal if.
Only the diagonal elements are non zero.

68
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,062
So, any element aij where j is not equal
to i has to be equal to zero,

69
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:14,360
and so a diagonal element just because
these are going to be.

70
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,568
So, this is D11, D22,

71
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:20,940
D33 if I switch the order of those
subscripts.

72
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,040
They stay the same, so diagonal matrix is
automatically symmetric.

73
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,720
And again, if, the important thing here,
not that

74
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,220
it's symmetric, that should be pretty
obvious, but that

75
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,870
when I have a diagonal matrix, if I take

76
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,000
the transpose of it, I just get the matrix
back.

77
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,020
OK.

78
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,977
And so now I want to explain a

79
00:06:41,977 --> 00:06:45,400
little bit where diagonal matrices are
going to come from.

80
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,770
Sorry, where symmetric matrices are
going to come from.

81
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,210
So let's let R be any m by n matrix.

82
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,130
So here I'm using R just because I want

83
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,790
it to be a rectangular matrix, so, not
necessarily square.

84
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,309
So it has m rows and n columns.

85
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,079
Then the matrix A that I define as the
product of

86
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,790
R transposed and R is going to be a
symmetric matrix.

87
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,560
And so to show that all we have to do is

88
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,360
take the transpose of A and show that
that's equal to A.

89
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:25,820
So the way I'm going to do that I'll take
A is equal to R transpose R.

90
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,410
So then A transpose is just going to

91
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,930
be the transpose of the product R
transpose R.

92
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,758
And now I want to use the rules that I
gave a

93
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:43,800
couple of slides ago for how I can deal
with transposes of products.

94
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,501
So basically says I take the transpose of
the

95
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:49,510
pieces and I get them back in the opposite
order.

96
00:07:52,740 --> 00:08:00,132
So this R here becomes this R transposed
here and this R transposed here, well I

97
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:03,614
take the transpose of that So it's R

98
00:08:03,614 --> 00:08:06,420
transposed, transposed so it's going to
become R again.

99
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,812
So I have R transposed R and that's what I
initially was calling A,

100
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:17,858
so I can start out with any rectangular
matrix and if I make this matrix

101
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:23,040
R transposed R, then that product A is
going to be symmetric matrix.

102
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,920
And you can do something similar for A
equals RR transpose.

103
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,256
Let's see if I, okay, so I go through

104
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:36,720
this example again, so it's basically the
same idea.

105
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,870
I've defined A to be RR transpose.

106
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,761
And I'm going to take the transpose of
that and if I can show

107
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:47,150
that to equal to A, then A transpose
equals to A, so A is symentric.

108
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,110
And so the same thing happens, it's just
going to swap the two terms.

109
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,590
So I have R transpose, transposed, so
that's where this first term comes from.

110
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,730
The first piece of this product.

111
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:06,124
And then here I have an R and then I am
going to transpose it, so I end up with R

112
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:11,990
transpose, and then the transpose of a
transpose is just I get the matrix back.

113
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,614
So, that will be R, R transpose which

114
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:17,829
is A, so I get RR transpose is also
symmetric.

115
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,490
And so what we're going to find as we
start looking at matrix

116
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,285
factorizations is a lot of times were
going to start out with a

117
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:33,184
matrix r that's rectangular, And we're
going to do some calculation where we're

118
00:09:33,184 --> 00:09:37,720
going to end up the product r transpose r,
or r, r transpose.

119
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,370
Or maybe both of them.

120
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,448
And so symmetric matrices are going to
show up

121
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:47,090
sort of more often than you would expect
just randomly.

122
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,694
And there are a lot of nice properties of
symmetric

123
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:52,690
matrices that I'll get to later in this
set of lectures.

124
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,470
And the second type of matrix I want to
talk about is called a permutation matrix.

125
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,340
Again, a permutation matrix is going to be
square.

126
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,564
So it's a n by n permutation matrix, P,
has the rows

127
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:14,160
of, so this is I, the identity matrix but
in any order.

128
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,136
So the identity matrix, it has the, you
know, the first

129
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:19,910
row, the row that starts with a one, goes
on top.

130
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,530
The row that has a one in the second
position goes in the second place.

131
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,008
And if I shuffle those around in any way,
the matrix that

132
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:30,960
I end up with is going to be a permutation
matrix.

133
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,920
And so for a 3 by 3 matrices, there's 6
possible permutation matrices, so.

134
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,134
You know, one of the things I could get
when I shuffle

135
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:45,850
the rows around is, I could just get the
identity matrix back.

136
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,635
So we're actually going to count that as a

137
00:10:47,635 --> 00:10:50,380
permutation matrix that says just put
everything where it is.

138
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:58,740
And then these other ones, so the one's
I've labeled 21, 3,1 and 3,2.

139
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,469
What these

140
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:05,320
matrices are going to do when I multiply,
they're just going to swap rows.

141
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,980
So where this would be important, you
know,

142
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,850
when I was talking about pivets when we
doing

143
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,720
elimination it's possible that you could
end up

144
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,990
with a, you could end up with an equation.

145
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,100
There's no particular reason why the
equations have to be in any order.

146
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,532
And so if you had an equation that started
out, so you

147
00:11:24,532 --> 00:11:28,276
had 0 times x plus something times y plus
something times

148
00:11:28,276 --> 00:11:33,850
z equals something, and suppose I decided
to put that equation first.

149
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,420
Then I wouldn't have a pivot in the first
position.

150
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,910
So I probably wouldn't want that to be my
first equation in my system.

151
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,220
And so this is sort of the matrix way of
solving that problem.

152
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,192
If I needed to get that row out of the

153
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:49,330
first row, I could multiply by one of
these matrices.

154
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:49,570
So for

155
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,520
instance, I could swap it with the second
row.

156
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,508
And the other interesting that some of
these have is, if I multiply,

157
00:11:58,508 --> 00:12:04,790
P21 by P21, so this is the matrix that
swaps the first two letters.

158
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,420
If I do that again, I would get my
original matrix back.

159
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,760
So that means that P21 is it's own
inverse.

160
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,842
So it swaps row one and two but if I do
that again it puts,

161
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:17,589
you know, what was originally row one back
in row

162
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:20,620
one, and what was originally row two back
in row two.

163
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,260
The other interesting property that this
has is P inverse is the same as P

164
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:36,289
transpose.
So for P21, since this is a symmetric

165
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:43,710
matrix, and it's its own inverse, you have
this strange...

166
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,150
I guess I would call it duality, but

167
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,020
there's actually three things, so maybe
it's triality.

168
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,035
You have the matrix, its transpose, and
its inverse

169
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:52,620
all being the same matrix.

170
00:12:53,746 --> 00:12:57,538
for the more complicated ones, so if you
want to swap

171
00:12:57,538 --> 00:13:01,330
you know, more like pairs of rows then you
still have

172
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,201
this property that pre, p inverse is p
transpose, But you

173
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:10,569
don't have the property that that these
are their own inverses anymore.

174
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,166
As it is the example of what this is going
to do, so

175
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:22,240
the permutation matrix P32 that just swaps
the third row and the second row.

176
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,789
So if I have a vector 1 2 3, so it's the
column vector, so the

177
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:33,310
first row is just 1 2 3 Then it's just
going to give me 1, 3, 2.

178
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,673
So it took what ever was in the third

179
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:36,630
position and will put it in the second
position.

180
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,220
Whatever was in the second position put it
in the third position.

181
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,066
And then if I multiply the output of this,
so 1, 3, 2 by

182
00:13:46,066 --> 00:13:50,840
the same permutation matrix again and it's
just going to swap the 3 and 2.

183
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,005
puts the vector back in the original order
1,2,3.
