1
00:00:01,149 --> 00:00:10,873
Topic two, vector spaces and subspaces.

2
00:00:10,873 --> 00:00:11,373
So the space RN, so you'll think of to get started, if I had R1 you can think of that as just a real number lines, so that would be any one real number, or what I've been calling a scalar value R2.

3
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,696
I, I've been using that when I mean points
in the planes, I mean

4
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:31,080
it's a point in XY plane that I could
write this to say like 1,3.

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:39,940
And in general, you have a space called RN
which is just the space.

6
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,620
That I can get.

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,880
So if I have a vector with N components,
then I can describe points in RN.

8
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,855
So the first, just like, so in R2, I need
the first component

9
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:52,130
to give me the X, the X coordinate.

10
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,710
And I need the second component to give me
the y coordinate.

11
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,152
If it was R3 I'd need the third component
to give me the Z coordinate in RN.

12
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:04,924
It's gets very difficult to visualize but
you know r or

13
00:01:04,924 --> 00:01:09,199
m can often be medium sized 100s or
thousand or millions.

14
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:15,135
But everything we're doing still actually
works and sometimes it's actually easier.

15
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:20,862
Then think about the problem got even
though it's 1 million dimensional space,

16
00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:26,150
to think about this in this column space
rather than in the, the row space.

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,205
So RN is generally going to be the whole
space, so that's everything you

18
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:34,480
can possibly write down, every point you

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,149
could possibly write down using n
components.

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,814
So R3 would just be what we think of as
space.

21
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:47,659
So there is no point in space that I
couldn't describe If I knew where

22
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,277
the origin was and I knew what direction x
axis was and the y axis.

23
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:55,337
Well then just those two then I also know
the

24
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:58,518
z axis and I could assign any point in
space.

25
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,878
Three numbers that would describe that
point, so

26
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:04,918
a vector with three components fill up a
space

27
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:08,513
that we generally would call 3 dimensional
space.

28
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:11,890
The space R2 is just going to be the x, y
plane.

29
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,910
So once I have an origin.

30
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,738
I can describe any point in the plane by
go, I guess I need an origin and

31
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,454
an x axis and then from that I can

32
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:24,110
pick the perpendicular direction to get a
y axis.

33
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,302
And once I have those two axis, then I can
describe

34
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:30,874
any point in the plane just with a single
x coordinate and

35
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:35,101
a single y coordinate and those would then
be all of the vectors.

36
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:41,950
I could draw with Putting the tail at 0 0
and the head at that point, x comma y.

37
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,706
In the two essential vector operations go
on inside the vector space so right

38
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:58,590
now it seems kind of strange because I've
just said, well we have this whole space.

39
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,406
And so every operation that I've already
talked about gives,

40
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:05,286
you know, if I have a vector of three
elements,

41
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:07,950
or three components, and I add it to a
vector

42
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,100
of three components, then I get a vector
with three components.

43
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,012
So it means a vector

44
00:03:13,012 --> 00:03:15,634
in 3 dimensional space plus a vector in 3
dimensional

45
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:18,470
space has an answer that's also in 3
dimensional space.

46
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,577
Can add any two vectors in RN.

47
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,713
What can multiply a vector in RN by a
scalar, And that's

48
00:03:26,713 --> 00:03:30,880
always going to give me a vector back that
is still in RN.

49
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,310
So the result lies in the same vector
space at the thing

50
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,400
that I started out with or the things that
I started at with.

51
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,825
So a subset, or a subspace of a vector
space, is a set of vectors,

52
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:53,794
so including the zero vector.
So zero vector always has

53
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:57,870
to be in a subspace.
That satisfy two requirements.

54
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,080
So if U and w are vectors in the subspace,
and C is

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,384
any scalar value, then U plus W has to
also be in

56
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:17,089
the subspace, and C times W has to also be
in the subspace.

57
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,492
And so the way you want to think of this
is

58
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:25,060
if I was, so we live in three dimensional
space.

59
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,292
But you could have say a piece of graph

60
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:30,180
paper that you could imagine is the x, y
plane.

61
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,582
And so if you have two vectors that you
draw on your

62
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:37,040
graph paper.

63
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,204
I'm supposing you are the top of your desk
had z coordinate 0 then those vectors

64
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:48,920
could also be written with three
components but the z would always be a 0.

65
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,878
So there's still vectors in three
dimensional space.

66
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:55,466
But if I add anything you can draw on your
graph paper, if I draw

67
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:59,938
any two graph, or any two vectors on that
sheet of graph paper, the answer.

68
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:00,628
I'm always

69
00:05:00,628 --> 00:05:04,490
also going to be able to draw on that
piece of graph paper.

70
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,652
So that's, that graph paper you could
think of as a subspace

71
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:09,388
of three dimensional, so it's a

72
00:05:09,388 --> 00:05:12,400
two dimensional subspace of three
dimensional space.

73
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,788
And so, kind of, there are a few more, so
any line through the

74
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:26,160
origin, so for instance the x axis would
be a substance of three dimensional space.

75
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,090
Any plane through the origin, so I was
using the

76
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,620
xy plane as my example but you could take
any plane.

77
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,960
I could take this plane and tilt it a bit.

78
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,810
I guess rotating it keeps in in the same
plane.

79
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,970
Tilt it this way, tilt it that way.

80
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,610
As long as it contains the origin, that's
also

81
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,540
going to be a subspace of 3 dimensional
space.

82
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:47,670
Yeah?

83
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,750
>> What would be a

84
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,380
[UNKNOWN]

85
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,360
example of a subspace

86
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,990
[UNKNOWN]

87
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,455
that contains vectors that would not
follow these rules?

88
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:57,040
[CROSSTALK]

89
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,395
This is how, this is how I'm defining a
subspace, so you can't have a subspace

90
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:05,833
that doesn't define--
>> So what would be, an example I guess,

91
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:11,473
of, a region, or I, I guess I can't
imagine a, an area in two

92
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:17,119
or three dimensions that wouldn't, meet
these requirements.

93
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,501
I guess, sort of the point is, so remember
I'm imagining I'm living

94
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:30,307
in three-dimensional space, which isn't
really that hard,

95
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:35,558
because I live in three-dimensiional
space, and I'm thinking of my

96
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:40,661
piece of graph paper as a sub-space.
And I can make

97
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:45,575
the vectors in my graph paper vectors of
three components by just

98
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:48,460
always taking the z to be zero.

99
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,470
So a vector that wouldn't be in that
subspace would be the z axis.

100
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,268
You know if I took the vector 0, 0,

101
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:57,640
1, that would point directly out of my
graph paper.

102
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,292
So that's, I can't write the z axis as the
sum

103
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:03,080
of vectors that live in my graph paper
because it would

104
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,344
always, if I made a linear combination it
would always be

105
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:10,320
something times zero plus something times
zero in the z coordinate.

106
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,576
So that's kind of what you're, you're
decomposing three dimensional

107
00:07:15,576 --> 00:07:17,639
space into the x y plane and the z axis.

108
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,704
That, yeah, the, I, I guess that it's not

109
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:24,650
something that's easy to visualize, but
what you're after,

110
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:24,650
>>

111
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,451
[INAUDIBLE]

112
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:30,969
zero, zero, one, and, or, or something
similar, and does he mention

113
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:31,770
[INAUDIBLE]

114
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,250
exists in your subspace, or
>> Right and.

115
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,400
>> Maybe I'm missing the point.

116
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,219
The point is that it's a really exhaustive
and specific definition

117
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:41,870
[UNKNOWN].

118
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,840
>> The, the point is that's the easiest
one is the X Y plain.

119
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,920
But imagine if I tilted the plain.

120
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,904
Now you have points where everything's
still has to live in a plain

121
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:57,092
but you can have points in that plain that
have X Y and Z all non-zero.

122
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,930
But there's no way.

123
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,780
Because there's no vector in my, in that
subspace perpendicular to the plane.

124
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,800
There's no way for me to get off of the
plane.

125
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:12,490
So that, that's kind of I need I use the
xy plane because it's an easy example.

126
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,993
But you know what I want is really all
possible planes that could

127
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:22,060
be you know, they could exist in three
dimensions that contain the origin.

128
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,820
And I, I think really what we're after,
cause that's, that's kind

129
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,420
of is, the highest dimensional thing you
can even really, reasonably understand.

130
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:40,065
what I'll want to be able to do later on
Is you know these vectors

131
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:45,370
will be in say like a seven dimensional
subspace of ten dimensional space.

132
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,524
So it's not something you can really
visualize.

133
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:49,986
but I'm just trying

134
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:53,220
to give you an idea of what it means you
know.

135
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,340
So you're sort of stuck in the things.

136
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,650
Like, you only need, if you're in a plane,
you only ever need two numbers.

137
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,620
To describe where you are.

138
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,302
If you are in three, like, full,

139
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:06,090
three-dimensional space, now I need three
numbers.

140
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,475
>> Mm-hm.

141
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:08,900
>> And so that, that's how it's going to
show up later on.

142
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,085
So, for instance, in in the x-y plane, if
z is always zero, then I only ever need

143
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:17,639
to know x and y to know where I am in my
subspace.

144
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,082
so being in that subspace is giving me a
constraint that allows

145
00:09:24,082 --> 00:09:28,728
me to get me the first two components of
that vector that

146
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:32,869
allows me to figure out what the third one
has to be

147
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:38,410
and so that's the property that is going
to be useful later one.

148
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,100
And also the whole space, so if

149
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,910
I'm talking about Three dimensional space.

150
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,514
All of three dimensional space is also

151
00:09:46,514 --> 00:09:49,550
going to satisfy my definition of a
subspace.

152
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,500
And the zero vector, so this is a
particularly easy one.

153
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,716
There's only one vector in the zero vector
subspace, so

154
00:09:57,716 --> 00:10:00,340
if I add it to itself, I still get zero.

155
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,180
And if I multiply it by any number, I
still get this zero vector.

156
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,152
So that also,

157
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:08,311
it seems like kind of a strange one to
have, but

158
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:13,900
it's, a vector that satisfies those two
properties, so it's a subspace.

159
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,380
Okay.

160
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,450
So one subspace It's particularly useful
in statistics

161
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,260
is that column space of a matrix a.

162
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,116
And so this ends up being all of the

163
00:10:33,116 --> 00:10:37,980
linear combinations I can write using the
columns of a.

164
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,424
So, the way I get a linear combination of
columns

165
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:44,270
of a matrix is I multiply it by a vector.

166
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,058
So this is.
When I, when I want to think

167
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:50,410
about what are the vectors that live in
the column space of A.

168
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,590
That's every vector I can write as A times
X.

169
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:01,135
So A is an M by N matrix, that means X has
to be a vector with N components.

170
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:01,540
[COUGH]

171
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,995
And, it's going to give me a linear
combination then of the columns

172
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:09,316
of A, and for every vector X that I pick,
I can get

173
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:13,771
a different output from that, and those
vectors are going to fill

174
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:18,160
up a space, and that's called the column
space of a matrix A.

175
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,320
Okay, so the, yeah, linear combinations
are things that I can write as ax.

176
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:34,800
And so remember when we were looking at
solving this problem ax equals b.

177
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,048
Well, this is, according to this
definition of this column space, this is

178
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:44,840
only going to be solvable if b is in the
column space of a.

179
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,704
So I think in, in the homework, and I also
gave a few quick examples

180
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:53,170
of, you know, sometimes you're not able to
solve a x equals b.

181
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,730
Or sometimes you end up with an infinite
numbers of solutions.

182
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,641
And so when you're not able to solve ax
equals b,

183
00:11:58,641 --> 00:12:02,262
so you end up getting something like zero
times y equals eight

184
00:12:02,262 --> 00:12:07,161
when you're doing your elimination, that
means that for that particular case,

185
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:10,760
for that particular a, the b that you are
trying to solve.

186
00:12:11,922 --> 00:12:13,826
in this equation here is not in the

187
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:18,190
column space of A, so you're not going to
be able to find an answer for that.

188
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,380
So if A is an M by N matrix then the
columns of A have M components.

189
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,520
So the columns live.

190
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,990
In a subspace that they live in the whole
space, r m.

191
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,670
And so the column space has to be a
subspace of r m.

192
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,062
So if a was, if n was equal to m,

193
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:49,069
that is possible that a can fill up the
whole space.

194
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,328
if there are fewer so for instance if you
just

195
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:56,772
think of a as being the identity matrix,
and what

196
00:12:56,772 --> 00:13:00,384
the identity matrix really is the first
row or first

197
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:04,248
column is 1, 0,0 that's a vector that just
points

198
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:07,776
along the x axis it points 1 in the x
direction, 0

199
00:13:07,776 --> 00:13:12,455
in the y direction, 0 in the x direction
The second column is

200
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:15,755
zero, one, zero, so that's a vector that
points in the y direction,

201
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:18,540
and the third one is a vector that points
in the z direction.

202
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,000
And so then when I take A times x, so if I
take i times

203
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,700
x, the reason that's equal to x is it's
just how I would write the,

204
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,470
you know, the point xyz.

205
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,302
In terms of, go so much in the X
direction, so much in the Y

206
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:37,485
direction, and so much in the Z direction,

207
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:41,050
it's a linear combination of my coordinate
axes.

208
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,470
If I only had the first two columns, I
could never get in the Z direction.

209
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,142
So, even though my vectors are still
length three, so I'd have

210
00:13:50,142 --> 00:13:54,808
one, zero, zero and zero, one, zero Now,
since I only have

211
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:58,390
these two vectors, I can't fill up the
whole of the space anymore.

212
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,780
I can only fill up a plane.

213
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,980
I can only get to points in the x-y plane.

214
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,790
And then, just a bit of notation.

215
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,109
So, for some reason, they call the column
space the range

216
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:16,880
of a matrix, so that the notation is r of
a.

217
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,109
So I think R is going to get used quite
often as a variable or a function here, so

218
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:27,680
in case when I write it like this, R of a
matrix, I mean the range of the matrix.

219
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,090
And that's the subspace of vectors that I
can write as linear combinations

220
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,500
of the columns of A.
So R stands for range.

221
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:38,950
Okay.

222
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,030
Then, another space that's, will show up
as being important in statistics is called

223
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:51,870
the nullspace of a.
And this consists of all of the solutions.

224
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,720
So here I'm looking at solutions x to the
equation a x equals zero.

225
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,060
So remember, I said the zero vector, was,
it's own subspace.

226
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,830
So you always get that one for free.

227
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,662
If I put in

228
00:15:05,662 --> 00:15:09,614
zero for X, then i'm going to get A times
zero

229
00:15:09,614 --> 00:15:14,335
is equal to zero, so zero is always in the
nullspace.

230
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:15,045
[COUGH]

231
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:19,510
The nullspace of A is denoted by.

232
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,907
N of A so we had R of A for the column
space and then N of A

233
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:25,909
for the nullspace and so again remember
when I

234
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:29,622
was talking about using the identity
matrix as my matrix

235
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:31,913
A if I took off the third column then

236
00:15:31,913 --> 00:15:35,073
the points I couldn't get to are the
points that

237
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:41,410
are on the Z axis so that would mean the Z
axis could be the nullspace of that matrix

238
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,690
And the column space would be the xy
plane.

239
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,623
And where you're going to end up with a
nullspace

240
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:54,270
is if you have a matrix where when you do
elimination.

241
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:59,560
So for this case I'm going to subtract two
times the first row from the second row.

242
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,530
That's going to give me; 0, 0, 2.

243
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,352
Now I'll subtract three times the first
row from the third

244
00:16:06,352 --> 00:16:09,830
row, and that's also going to give me 0,
0, 2.

245
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,275
So when I look at this

246
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:15,780
matrix here, there's no pivot for me in
the second column, so

247
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,280
I have to go to the third column to find
the pivot.

248
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,209
And then when I subtract the second row
from the

249
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:28,810
third row I end up with a row that's all
zeros.

250
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,850
So I end up with pivot only in the first
and third column,.

251
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,090
So I get variables in x1 and x3.

252
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:41,009
And I, and I'm going to call the variable
x2 a free variable.

253
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:49,014
And essentially what free variable means
is I can pick that, and then

254
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:52,590
I can solve for the other two in terms of
whatever I pick there.

255
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:58,180
So you can think of that as just sort of,
like y equals a function of x.

256
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,130
You have a dependent variable and an
independent variable.

257
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,310
So I can choose any value I want of the
independent variable, but once I've picked

258
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,230
that, I now have a function that gives

259
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,580
me a specific value of the dependent
variable.

260
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,704
And so if I, you know normally what I
expect

261
00:17:13,704 --> 00:17:15,533
to do, what I expect to get when I have

262
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:18,306
three equations and three unknowns, I
expect to be able

263
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:21,590
to solve that and get an answer, a single
point.

264
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:27,008
If I end up with when I, when I've done
eliminations, something like

265
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:33,650
this, now it's telling me is that I, I
sort of have zero times X2 can be zero.

266
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,961
So that means I can choose any value I
want for X2 and

267
00:17:36,961 --> 00:17:41,914
then I'm going to have, you know, based on
This equation

268
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:46,943
here I have someway of getting X X1 and X3
from

269
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:52,079
whatever value I choose for X2, and so I
am going to use that

270
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,108
to, to define kind of 1, 1 last important
property of

271
00:17:57,108 --> 00:18:02,024
a matrix which should be the rank of a
matrix And so the rank

272
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:04,820
of the matrix is going to be the number of
pivots of that matrix.

273
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,880
And so in this case, since I have, I have
a pivot here

274
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,080
and a pivot here, this matrix that I
started out with has rank two.

275
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,516
If on the other hand, if, if I got the
nice elimitation picture

276
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:24,960
where have non-zeros down the diagonal,
Then it would be a rank three matrix.

277
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,714
>> What is the null space then?

278
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:32,290
>> That's a, that, we have to take a
linear algebra class for.

279
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,360
It's, it's not really clear, from this,
exactly what the null space is.

280
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,150
But you can see that it has a, so it,

281
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,340
if you only have x equals 0, as the null
space

282
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,940
That's kind of a trivial null space.

283
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,210
It's sort of like saying anything times
zero is zero.

284
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,210
Here because I have this free variable I
don't have enough pivots.

285
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,090
It means I have a non-trivial null space.

286
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:58,410
It means I can actually, sorry, I can
actually find non zero vectors,

287
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,650
x, that are going to give, that are going
to satisfy this equation.

288
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,882
Okay, then I think the final concept for
this topic will be

289
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:19,168
linear independance.
So suppose I have a sequence of vectors,

290
00:19:19,168 --> 00:19:24,340
v 1 up to v n.
And I'm going to call that linearly

291
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,400
independent if and only if the only linear
combination that gives

292
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,184
the zero vector is 0 times v1 plus 0 times
v2, basically 0

293
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:37,320
times each one of these vectors.

294
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,520
So that's the only way to write the zero
vector.

295
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,175
So that columns of A are independent, so
linearly independent, if

296
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:54,370
and if the solution to Ax equals 0 is the
zero vector.

297
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,750
So that's just a, another way of stating
the same thing.

298
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,840
So this is the, the vector definition of
linearly independent.

299
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,610
This is sort of the Matrix definition of
linearly independent.

300
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,380
And so this is going to be true so that
the columns of A are going to

301
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,250
be linearly independent if when I do
elimination

302
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,690
on A, I don't have any free variables.

303
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:20,190
So that means I have to end up with a full
set of pivots as I'm doing elimination.

304
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,830
And in that case, the rank a is going to
be equal to

305
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,220
n, so I'm going to get a pivot in every,
in each column.

306
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,480
And if I have a pivot in each column,
there won't be any

307
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,900
free variables, so the null space of a
will contain only the zero vector.

308
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:44,390
Okay.

309
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,185
And then I'll say a set of vectors spans

310
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:53,520
a space if their linear combinations fill
that space.

311
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,720
So for instance, if I look at the identity
matrix, so's to

312
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,043
say three by three identity matrix I can
write any point in three-dimensional

313
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:05,562
space as x times the first column of the
identity matrix plus y

314
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:09,495
times the second column of the identity
matrix plus z times the third

315
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:12,020
column of the identity matrix.

316
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,420
So I'll say that the columns of the
identity matrix span the space r3.

317
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,430
So any point in that space.

318
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:25,140
Can be written as a linear combination of
the vectors that span that space.

319
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,510
And then a basis for a vector space is
going

320
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,590
to be a sequence of vectors so same thing
as this.

321
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,870
They need to be one linearly independent.

322
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,070
And two, they need to span the space.

323
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,650
And so again this is something like my, my

324
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,110
columns of the identity matrix would,
would solve this.

325
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,611
they're linearly independent and they span
the

326
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:57,807
space and, that's a very trivial example

327
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:02,560
but that's kind of what you're trying to
say, so it's the columns Of your

328
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,535
matrix, give you a way, so I can write
every point in r3 as some

329
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,160
linear combination of the columns of that

330
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,235
matrix and then the identity matrix is
obviously

331
00:22:12,235 --> 00:22:17,070
just the easiest way to do that, which is
why that's what everybody uses.

332
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,480
Then the dimension of a vector space.

333
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,020
Is going to be the number of vectors in
the basis.

334
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,616
And so since every basis has to have the
same number of

335
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:33,130
vectors we say it's the, it's the number
of vectors in every basis.

336
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,238
And so again if I'm talking about R three
I need

337
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:42,750
the columns of the three by three identity
matrix to span that.

338
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,730
That's also going to be a basis for R
three.

339
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,645
And so the dimension is just going to be
the number of vectors which

340
00:22:48,645 --> 00:22:52,150
is the number of columns of the three by
three identity matrix which is three.
