1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,420
So welcome to week six of mathematical
methods for quantitative finance.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,490
We're going to continue this week talking
about linear algebra.

3
00:00:09,582 --> 00:00:13,118
last week we got the basics down, vectors,
matrices and

4
00:00:13,118 --> 00:00:17,710
some of the arithmetic rules for working
with vectors and matrices.

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,735
And now we're going to look a little bit
deeper into factorizations

6
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:23,680
of matrices and the types of problems you
can solve with them.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,150
So this week's

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,980
menu, I'll start off with a few more a few
more properties or types of matrices.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,970
So there's a, a transpose, is an operation
you can do on a matrix.

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,140
And a permutation is another operation you
can do on a matrix.

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,790
And then I'll talk a little bit about
vector spaces and sub spaces.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,155
And then I really want to get in to sort
of the

13
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:50,870
meat of this weeks lectures which are
going to be operations.

14
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,990
So, when you want to do something to a
data set

15
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,430
Often that something can be written down
as a matrix

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,110
and then I can complete that operation
just by doing, matrix multiplication or

17
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,649
some potentially more complicated formula
involving matrix manipulations.

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,880
And the example I'm going to use to, to
show

19
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,166
how that can be done is variance,
covariance matrix which

20
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,018
in section four I just start calling
covariance matrix

21
00:01:19,018 --> 00:01:22,330
because the full name is kind of difficult
to pronounce.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,186
Then in lecture five I'm going to
introduce

23
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:30,700
yet another type of matrix called an
orthoganal matrix.

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,352
And this is a matrix that has a very

25
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:35,200
nice property that it's inverse is also
its transpose.

26
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,118
And then I'm going to look at

27
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,054
some factorizations of matrices that
basically involve

28
00:01:43,054 --> 00:01:49,696
factoring, the full matrix into orthogonal
matrices and then one more matrix that has

29
00:01:49,696 --> 00:01:52,750
some sort of special property.

30
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,822
So in the singular value factorization I'm

31
00:01:54,822 --> 00:01:57,410
going to end up with two orthogonal
matrices.

32
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,371
So these are very easy matrices to work
with because they

33
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:04,030
have this nice property their inverse is
equal to their transpose.

34
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,800
And then the third matrix is going to be a
diagonal matrix which that means that

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,000
if, if I look down the main diagonal of
the matrix, those elements are non zero.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,220
But any other element has to be zero.

37
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,470
And so again, this is a very easy matrix
to work with because

38
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,760
it's inverse is just the reciprocal of
each one of those diagonal elements.

39
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,154
And then I'm going to use the singular

40
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:32,973
value factorization to motivate something
called the eigenvalues

41
00:02:32,973 --> 00:02:35,854
and eigenvectors and then finally in
section eight

42
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:39,090
I'm going to look at solving something
called a least.

43
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,430
Squares problem.

44
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,304
And so this is if I have a, a scatter
plot.

45
00:02:43,304 --> 00:02:47,210
values so I have x values on the x axis, y
values on the y axis.

46
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,920
And then I want to put a best fit line
onto that plot.

47
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,421
The, the slope and the y intercept at that
best,

48
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:58,240
best fit line you calculate by solving a
least squares problem.

49
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,314
And so I'm going to go over how you can
use

50
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:04,140
a matrix factorization called a QR
factorization to solve that problem.
