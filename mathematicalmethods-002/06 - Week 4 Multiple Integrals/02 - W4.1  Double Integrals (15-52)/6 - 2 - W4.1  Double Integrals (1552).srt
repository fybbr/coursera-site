1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,380
Okay.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,130
So, this week, we will be talking about
multiple integrals.

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,090
So here's a brief menu for what we will
have.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,160
first I'll introduce something called a
double integral.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,976
So it's basically just a two dimensional
version of

6
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:21,490
the single variable integral we started
with in week two.

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,430
And then I'll talk about something called
Fubini's Theorem.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,032
And this is going to be the, the bit

9
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:31,630
that actually allows us to compute double
integrals.

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,360
And then we have something called change
of variables.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,200
This is basically just the substitution
method, but when we're doing

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,610
it with two variables there's sort of a
lot more flexibility.

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,220
So I'll teach you how to, how to set that
up.

14
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,350
And then in section four, we'll work
through an example of that.

15
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,250
And then section five is pretty short.

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,058
There's a special situation where you have
something called

17
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:58,940
separability, which allows you to write a
double integral.

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,368
It's just a product of two single

19
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:01,410
variable integrals.

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,600
So it makes it a lot easier a lot easier
to evaluate.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,540
And then in Wednesday's lecture, we'll
talk about switching to polar coordinates.

22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,970
So, in section three, we talked about
change of variables.

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,079
Section six, polar coordinates is just one

24
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,709
particular change of variables that we can
do.

25
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,510
section seven, a culturally important
integral.

26
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,398
So this is why there's this 1 over the

27
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:27,227
square root of 2 pi in the front of the

28
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:27,640
[UNKNOWN]

29
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,260
function.

30
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,962
And then eight is, this is just something
that's going to come

31
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:38,480
up reasonably often, so we need to compute
a marginal density function.

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,376
So, when you have a density function that
has two or more random variables in it,

33
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:46,256
sometimes you want to know what would the
density

34
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:49,000
of one of those random variables look
like.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,280
And this is the way to do it.

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,994
That's actually a result that'll be more
applicable

37
00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:55,295
to 461, but the, the math definitely fits

38
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:58,460
in nicely in this class.
So, I'll go through one example of that.

39
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,460
Okay.

40
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,099
So we'll get started with double
integrals.

41
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,968
So just a quick reminder of what

42
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:15,140
is the integral of a single-variable
function doing.

43
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,668
So the problem that I tried to, I set out
to solve,

44
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:23,220
was I have this function f of x on some
interval ab.

45
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,530
And I want to come up with how much area
is underneath f of x, in between a and b.

46
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,110
And so, the approach I took was, I just
decided I was going to come

47
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,470
up with a lower bound by fitting these red
rectangles underneath f of x.

48
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,414
And then I was going to estimate the area
underneath f

49
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:48,380
of x just as the sum of the areas of these
rectangles.

50
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,880
And then I define the idea of a definite
integral to just be this sum.

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,223
So, this thing that I'm trying to
highlight right

52
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:02,069
here, f of a plus i times delta x.

53
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,810
So, if I start with i equals zero, then a
plus i delta x is just going to

54
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,960
be a, and f of a is just going to be the
height of this rectangle.

55
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,616
So it's the height of the first rectangle.

56
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:16,466
And then I'm going to multiply that by
delta x,

57
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:19,280
where delta x is the width of the
rectangle.

58
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,726
And here, so delta x is just going to be b

59
00:03:22,726 --> 00:03:25,970
minus a, so the size of the interval
divided by n.

60
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,642
And the as I make n bigger and bigger, so
I try and cram more

61
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:35,575
triangles underneath this curve, my
estimate, my approximation

62
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:38,620
for this area is getting better and
better.

63
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,212
And if I take the limit of that as n goes
to infinity, then I'm going

64
00:03:43,212 --> 00:03:48,200
to say that, that's the area of underneath
the f of x in between a and b.

65
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,800
Well, that's what we did in with a single
variable integral.

66
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,550
For a double

67
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,600
integral we're going to try and do the
same thing, but now with two variables.

68
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,360
So it's really a three dimensional
problem.

69
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,710
We're thinking of z as being a function of
x and oops, and y here.

70
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:13,196
And now, instead of putting rectangles
underneath the curve, I'm going to try and

71
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:18,630
build these sort of rectangular solids.
And I'm going to try and put

72
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,970
them underneath the surface.

73
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,050
And then the idea is that I'm trying,

74
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,723
I want to compute the volume under this
surface.

75
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:29,440
So it's going, the interpretation that
I'm, I'm going for

76
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,110
is the volume between the xy plane and the
surface z.

77
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,990
And so again like the single variable
integral.

78
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,590
If the surface is above the xy plane, I'm
going to get a positive volume,

79
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,610
and if the surface is below the x-y plane,
I'm going to get a negative volume.

80
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,670
And then here, just with four of these
things,

81
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,600
you can see that it's not a very good
approximation.

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,759
There's quite a bit missing, but if I
instead

83
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,860
used you know, and I'm dividing each
interval into four.

84
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,630
So it's getting a little bit better.

85
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,270
And then you can go to eight.

86
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,034
So now I guess there's 64 of these little

87
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:10,500
things, and it's starting to resemble the
surface more.

88
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,286
And so my definition of a double integral

89
00:05:14,286 --> 00:05:18,470
then, for this particular problem, the
domain of integration.

90
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,850
So that's the area in the xy plane, where

91
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,730
I'm trying to, where I'm interested in
estimating the volume.

92
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,130
So, the first one is going to be the x
dimension.

93
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,340
So I want to go 0 to 2 in the x direction.
And then I want to go zero to two in the

94
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,374
y direction.
And then, this surface is

95
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:40,610
my f of x, y.

96
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,827
And now I need something to sort of say
what my

97
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:48,330
variable of integration is, so I'm just
going to say dA here.

98
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,880
And dA, you can sort of think of that as
the size of one of these little.

99
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,860
In general, they'll be rectangles, but in
this, they're squares.

100
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,799
So it's the base of each one of these
columns.

101
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,440
And then I'm going to take the limit as m
and n go to infinity.

102
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,860
And here, just like I, I did with my red
rectangles.

103
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,320
Essentially, all I'm doing is this
function is

104
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,350
assigning a height to one of these
columns.

105
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,680
And then delta A is the area of the base
of one of these columns.

106
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,920
So the volume of each column is going to

107
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,480
be given by the, the thing in the sum
here.

108
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,280
And then hopefully,

109
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,840
my approximation gets better and better,
and better as as m and n get bigger.

110
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,880
And in the limit, it would be equal to the

111
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,020
volume under the surface, which is what
I'm trying to get.

112
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,972
And so, just at the bottom here, I

113
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:42,349
have definitions of all the quantities
I've used.

114
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,160
So, in general, when I want to integrate
over a rectangle.

115
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,320
So I'm going to, I'm going to be using
this notation pretty commonly.

116
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,230
So R just means a rectangular region.

117
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,000
There's no particularly good reason, it's
just I had to chose some letter.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,270
And since it's a rectangle I chose R.
And when I write it like this,

119
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,626
[a, b] cross [c,d].
What I mean is the rectangle with one side

120
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:21,040
parallel to the x axis going from x equals
a to x equals b.

121
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,450
And the other side parallel to the y axis
going from y equals c to y equals d.

122
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,108
And so, now I'm going to say that the
double integral

123
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:36,768
over this region R, is going to be equal
to

124
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:39,580
the same limit I had on the last page,
except

125
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,220
on the last slide, except now I'm just
re-writing it.

126
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,340
So instead of just being ix, I have to
start at a and go ix.

127
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:54,270
And and then for y, I'm going to start at
c and go j times y.

128
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,857
So just stepping along the y

129
00:07:55,857 --> 00:08:00,260
axis in steps of delta y, and stepping
along the x axis and steps of delta x.

130
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,492
And then the interpretation of this So
like I was trying to argue

131
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:13,920
before, is if f of x y is greater than or
equal to 0.

132
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,922
So that's basically just saying that the
surface I'm

133
00:08:17,922 --> 00:08:21,503
trying to integrate under is above the xy
plane.

134
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,563
Then I can interpret the, the value of
this integral

135
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:31,508
as the volume of the region above R and
beneath the,

136
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:36,467
the surface z equals f of xy.
So like the, like the

137
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:41,225
single variable integral, we get some,
some

138
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:46,700
pretty useful properties that are going to
just help.

139
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,340
You know, without evaluating the integral
we can at

140
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,250
least rewrite it in, in terms of its
terms.

141
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,566
Split it into two integrals in this case.
So we have one linearity

142
00:08:56,566 --> 00:09:02,450
property, which is just saying that if I
integrate a sum of two simpler functions.

143
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,234
So in this case, I have the function I'm
integrating, can be

144
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:12,670
written as one function of x and y f, and
another function of x and y g.

145
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,688
Then the integral of this sum is equal to
the sum of

146
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:21,686
the two, sorry, sum of the two integrals
yeah, had it right

147
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:26,919
the first time.
Then the second property that I'm going to

148
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:32,136
also throw under this name linearity, is
if I scale

149
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:36,984
my function by.
So c here is going to be a real

150
00:09:36,984 --> 00:09:41,812
valued constant, then the integral of c

151
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:47,350
times f of x, c times f of x, y is equal
to c times

152
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,500
the integral of f of x, y.

153
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,320
And then I didn't really know what to call

154
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,540
this property, so I, I came up with
comparison.

155
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,190
But it should be reasonably intuitive.

156
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,880
So, if I have two functions f of x y and g
of x y.

157
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,200
And everywhere in my domain of
integration.

158
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,908
So this is my, my rectangle R.

159
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,430
If f of x y is greater than or equal to g
of x y.

160
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,260
So one surface is completely above the
other.

161
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:20,200
or some, some places they might touch,
which is what the equality would mean.

162
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,710
But if they don't touch, then f of x y is
above g of x y.

163
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,323
Then there has to be more volume
underneath the

164
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:30,510
surface f than there is underneath the
surface g.

165
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,211
So we'd say that that the

166
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:32,616
[COUGH]

167
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:35,694
the double integral of f over R is greater
than

168
00:10:35,694 --> 00:10:38,650
or equal to the double integral of g over
R.

169
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:44,250
Okay.

170
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,690
And then there's another related integral
called an iterated integral.

171
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,760
And so, I'm going to suppose that f of x,
y is continuous on the rectangle R.

172
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,888
So again, R is just a, b in the x
direction and c, d in the y direction.

173
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:06,120
And I'm going to introduce a concept
called partial integration.

174
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,006
And so this is sort of the, the backward
idea of

175
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:11,640
partial differentiation.

176
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,968
So, in partial differentiation, if I have
a function of x and

177
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:18,840
y, and I want to take the partial
derivative with respect to y.

178
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,220
I pretend x is a constant, so I fix x, and
I

179
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,040
take the derivative, treating the function
as a function of y alone.

180
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,960
In partial integration, I'm going to do
exactly

181
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,800
the same thing, except just the other
direction.

182
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,050
So I'm going to fix x.

183
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,936
Basically, when I say fix x, I mean
pretend x is a constant.

184
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:41,710
And then I'm going to integrate f of x y
as if it were a function of y alone.

185
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,600
And so that's just going to give me a
function of x.

186
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,500
So when I integrate from c to d of f of x
y, dy, the y is going to disappear,

187
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,900
because after I compute an anti-derivative
for f of

188
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,316
x y, treating it just as a function of y.

189
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:06,650
I'm then going to replace those, the y's
in the anti-derivative with c's and d's.

190
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:09,247
So, when I'm all done evaluating this
definite integral

191
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:12,450
on the right-hand side, there aren't
going to be any y's left in it.

192
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:17,080
But there still might be some x's, and so
that's going to be my function A of x.

193
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,920
And then I can do something called an
iterated integral.

194
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,614
So, an iterated integral is just going to
be

195
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:30,650
the integral of A of x with respect to x.

196
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:35,820
So now I consider integrating from a to b
my function A of x dx.

197
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,140
And this is just going to be a single
variable integral.

198
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,650
But then remember how we defined a of x.

199
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,328
That was just the integral from

200
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:46,900
c to d of f of x y dy.

201
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,675
So I could also write me iterated integral
in

202
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:52,460
this form that I have on the right hand
side.

203
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,530
And so, I think you can see kind of why
it's called iterated integral.

204
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,330
It's giving me sort of a, a hierarchy, so
I can

205
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,340
evaluate this thing by first doing the
integral in the square brackets.

206
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,430
That's going to give me a function of x.

207
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,489
And then I can integrate that using

208
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:10,471
this outside integral, which is just an
integral

209
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:11,980
of a function of x alone.

210
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,802
And then, most of the time when people
write

211
00:13:17,802 --> 00:13:20,160
this down, they are going to omit the
brackets.

212
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,620
So, both sides of the equality here, they
mean exactly the same thing.

213
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,863
And usually when I'm trying to do one of
these on my own,

214
00:13:27,863 --> 00:13:31,870
I put the brackets back in just to make
sure that everything lines up.

215
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,160
So that the important thing to notice,
that the brackets will help you with,

216
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,640
is that this is something that you're
going to do from the inside out.

217
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,022
So the first integral, oops, the first
integral is an

218
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:51,850
integral from c to d.
And c and d, these are the y coordinates.

219
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,329
So remember on my rectangle, the, the c
and

220
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:57,220
the d are describing the height of the
rectangle.

221
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,120
So the bottom and the top of the
rectangle.

222
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,000
So they're in the y coordinate.

223
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,806
So, whatever limits are on here, they have
to correspond to the

224
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:08,790
first, so in this case d y comes first.

225
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:13,150
So c, d are the limits for integrating
with respect to y.

226
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:18,870
And then, once that's done, the next layer
out is going to be the dx layer.

227
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:24,030
And so the integral, the, the limits on
the outside integral ab, they

228
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:29,140
correspond to doing the dx dy, sorry they
correspond to doing the dx.

229
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:30,880
And so,

230
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,870
if you put the brackets in here, just as
one more reminder, that the

231
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,040
limits here have to correspond to the

232
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,400
variable that I'm integrating with respect
to here.

233
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,446
And then, there's no reason why we
couldn't iterate

234
00:14:47,446 --> 00:14:49,990
the other way, so I could also rewrite
this.

235
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:55,120
And notice, all I've done here, I had dy
dx, here I had dx dy.

236
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,331
So in order to rewrite this integral, I

237
00:14:57,331 --> 00:15:00,080
had to change tho, the integral signs as
well.

238
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,344
So I now have ab corresponding to the dx

239
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:07,380
and then integral c to d corresponding to
the dy

240
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,020
And so, it's a pretty common mistake I
think,

241
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,510
you know, if you don't put these brackets
here.

242
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,059
That you will eventually use the limits
for the

243
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:23,320
other variable when you integrate the, the
inside function.

244
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,592
And so, then the big question we're going
to

245
00:15:29,592 --> 00:15:33,040
have is, what is the relationship between
a double integral?

246
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,320
So a double integral, this is, this is the
thing we want.

247
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,610
What I want to do is be able to compute
the area underneath a surface.

248
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,600
And this iterated integral on the right
hand side.

249
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,160
This is something I can actually compute.

250
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,440
And so we'll get to that question in the
next set of slides.
