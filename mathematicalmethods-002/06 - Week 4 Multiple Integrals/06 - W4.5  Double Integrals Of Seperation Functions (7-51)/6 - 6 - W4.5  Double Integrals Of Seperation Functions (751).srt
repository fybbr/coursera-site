1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,730
Picking up where we left off last time,
we're

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,780
on lesson number five, double integrals of
separable functions.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,830
This really was meant to follow up part
four,

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,710
where we had a function, I did a change

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,970
of variables, and then it wasn't that much
easier

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,319
to integrate after I did the change of
variables.

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,130
But there was a trick that we missed, and
so that's what this

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,390
section will, will cover.

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,580
So if we look back at what we did last
time.

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,160
We had this integral here, which this is
what the function was.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,200
This was just x, and then we transformed
into s and t.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,920
So this is what x got transformed into.
And then we had oops, the absolute value

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,340
of the Jacobian here, and then ds dt.
And then I'll rewrite that

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,440
in this more power rule slash anti-power
rule friendly

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,420
form of just each each variable to a
power.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,300
And

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,570
now, if you look at where I've put the
square brackets here.

18
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,310
oops, so this is, this is the way we tried
to do it last time.

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,935
So I just pretended this is a function of
s and t.

20
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:23,620
I'm going to inter, I going to do the
partial integral of this with respect to

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:29,355
s first, evaluated at s equals 2 and
subtract it evaluated at s equals 1.

22
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,030
But, if we look at this a little

23
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,800
bit closer, any function of t, since we're
doing

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:44,390
a, a partial integral, any function of t
is going to be constant with respect to s.

25
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,960
So I can move, I have this integral

26
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,330
sign here corresponds to integration with
respect to s.

27
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,816
So the inside integral sign and the inside
variable here,

28
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:00,130
the, they correspond to one another.

29
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,980
And anything, and, and these are
corresponding to the variable s,

30
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,380
anything that's not an s is constant with
respect to this integral.

31
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,930
So I can move that across the integral
sign, and

32
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,030
I'll get what I have on the right-hand
side here.

33
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,352
So I, I get the t to the minus 3

34
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:20,440
halves, that's constant with respect to
this integral in here.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,770
So I'm going to bring it out front.

36
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,460
And now I have something that only depends
on s here.

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,310
And so what this is going to allow me to
do is express this integral

38
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,930
as the product of two definite integrals

39
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,360
that are integrals of single variable
functions.

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,230
So I have here an integral, oops.

41
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,960
just of s alone.

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,900
And then multiplied by an integral on the,
on the right of t alone.

43
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,390
And so the reason I was able to do that

44
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,280
is, if I look at his function here, that I
can't

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,940
seem to highlight right now, just get a
little bit

46
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,320
or it so people can see where the mouse
pointer is.

47
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,190
Everything in this set of square brackets,
I can do

48
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,880
that integral and that's just going to be
a real number.

49
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,930
And so, I can just treat the whole thing,

50
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,480
whether I evaluate it and get the real
number.

51
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,260
Or I just keep it in these square
brackets.

52
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,650
It's constant, so I can bring that across
this integral sign here.

53
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,665
And now, this is going to be obviously,
quite a bit easier,

54
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:32,550
because I can do each one of these
integrals independently now.

55
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,230
So here I've just computed the
anti-derivative

56
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,630
of the first function, anti derivative of

57
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,930
the second function, then I'll have to

58
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,490
to evaluate them at their limits and
subtract.

59
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:56,630
so I'm just using the fundamental theorem
of calculus Independently now.

60
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,338
Once for this function of s and once for
this function of t.

61
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:04,770
And let's see.

62
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,050
So the rest of it is just a little bit of
algebra.

63
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,900
And I don't suppose anybody remembers the
thing I told you to remember on Monday.

64
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,420
But it was, so last time it was negative 6
plus 5 root 2 over 3.

65
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,870
This time it's 5 root 2 minus 6 over 3.

66
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,950
but because we're able to separate this
integral, I, well

67
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,070
at least for me I felt it was a lot for

68
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,040
me to evaluate it this way than it was to

69
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,250
evaluate it trying to integrate it twice
as an iterated integral.

70
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,360
And so, in general, this is going to work

71
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,110
only when we have a rectangular domain of
integration.

72
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,960
So this isn't going to work if the limits
of one of the integral depend on the

73
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,180
value in the other integral.

74
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,170
because then, I'm not, it's still going to
have

75
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,380
some dependence on the, the first partial
integral

76
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,320
will have some dependence, not in the
function,

77
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,640
not in the integrand, but in the limits.

78
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,690
So I won't be able to move that across the
other

79
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,960
I won't be able to remove that across the
other integral.

80
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,090
So I have to have a rectangular domain of
integration.

81
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,590
And

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,580
then I have to be able to take the

83
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,860
integrand, this is the function I'm trying
to integrate.

84
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,670
And I need to be able to write that as a
product of

85
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,920
a function of the first variable times a
function of the second variable.

86
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,920
And then I can express the double integral
of f

87
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,520
over r as the product of these two single
variable integrals.

88
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,040
So the double integral of f over r becomes
the integral.

89
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,730
So remember, this is f, but now I'm
going to use the fact that I

90
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,090
can separate it into a product of g of x
and h of y.

91
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,890
And then the ab limits correspond to
integration with respect to x.

92
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,240
And the cd limits correspond to
integration with respect to y.

93
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,180
And then because h of y, this is going

94
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,330
to be constant when I'm integrating with
respect to x.

95
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,240
So I can bring that out in front of the
integral sign.

96
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,030
The dx integral sign.

97
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,200
And now inside the square brackets, I have
something

98
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,979
that I could just integrate and replace
with a constant.

99
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,590
And so, since this quantity inside the
square brackets

100
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,740
is constant, I can move that out in front

101
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,310
of my dy integral.

102
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,690
And so what I'm left with is a product of
a definite integral

103
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,065
with resp g of x dx, and another definite
integral, h of y dy.

104
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:48,770
And so this was this was an

105
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,600
example of kind of the forward use of, of
this property.

106
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,980
So I had a function of s and t that I

107
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,040
could accept, it was a function of s times
the function

108
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,860
of t, so I was able to separate that.

109
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,870
It got easier when I did the change of
variables, because

110
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,320
I took my diamond, and I turned it into a
rectangle.

111
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,300
So that allowed me then to, to use this
property.

112
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,500
the other thing that will seem kind of

113
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,300
strange is that I can also use this
backwards.

114
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,310
So it, sometimes.

115
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,679
And in fact, we're going to have a lesson
on that in a little bit.

116
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,930
if I have two integrals of this form.

117
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,490
So an integral a

118
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,950
single variable function times the
integral of a

119
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,580
single variable function that I'm not able
to compute.

120
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,270
So each of these, this side and this side.

121
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:46,420
I'm not able to do When I multiply them
together, I am able to evaluate it.

122
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,520
So that'll give me a sort of a interesting
way to solve one particular problem.
