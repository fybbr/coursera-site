1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,435
So the next topic is, a Change of
Variables Example,

2
00:00:04,435 --> 00:00:08,270
so a slightly more complicated version of
what we just did.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,510
And this one I, I took from the textbook.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,959
And I found it when I was reading the book
getting ready to do this class I found it.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,740
I thought sort of too complicated, so I
thought it would be a good

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,948
thing to go through step by step just to
make sure everybody understands it.

7
00:00:25,948 --> 00:00:30,832
So I want to evaluate the double integral
over

8
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:35,980
domain D of x dx dy, where this domain D
is going to

9
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:42,316
be points in the xy plane, where x is
greater than or equal

10
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:48,650
to zero, then the product x and y is in
between 1 and 2.

11
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,271
And then y divided by x is also between 1
and 2.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,440
And so it turns out we can assume that x
is greater than zero.

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,570
I wrote assume here.

14
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,720
You don't really have to assume.

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,650
You can actually see that it's greater
than zero.

16
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,010
[COUGH]

17
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,340
So it's easier if you rewrite the domain
so solve for one of the variables.

18
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,000
So generally I like to see y as a function
of x.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,270
That's what I'm most comfortable plotting.

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:29,380
So if I solve for y, if I can isolate y,
then I can just say y equals 1 over x.

21
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,650
That has to be kind of a lower bound in
some sense.

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,436
And y less than or equal

23
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:35,930
to 2 over x.
So y equals 2 over x.

24
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,410
That's going to be kind of an upper bound.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,730
And then the same thing is going to happen
with the second set of limits.

26
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,410
So I have.
x less than or equal to y.

27
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,324
That's just the line y equals x, and the
function, the

28
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:50,420
domain has to be above that because it's y
greater than x.

29
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,880
And then there's also going to be a line y
equals 2x, and that has to

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,270
be kind of an upper bound, because it says
that y has to be below that.

31
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,080
And so once you've gotten this far, what
you want to do next.

32
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,340
Is, just draw a picture.

33
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,230
So, I tried my artistic skills here.

34
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,850
And, so, the second condition, y has to be
greater than x.

35
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,610
So, the bottom side of this blue region is
the line y equal x.

36
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,850
In the top side of the blue region is the
line y equals 2x.

37
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,770
And this just says y has to be in between
those two lines.

38
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,440
So to be in my domain I have to be in my
blue region.

39
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,700
And then 1 over x so y has to be greater
than 1 over x.

40
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,719
So this line, the bottom of the yellow
reason is this line 1 over x.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,980
The top of this yellow regions is 2 over
x.

42
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,850
So this is 2 over x up here.

43
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,280
And so to be in the domain I also have to
be in the yellow region.

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,690
So I have to be in the blue region and I
have to be in the yellow region.

45
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,132
And if I remember my primary school

46
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:02,850
art class correctly, yellow and blue make
green.

47
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,950
So that tells me that this green shape is
the domain that they're talking about.

48
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,466
So this is, this description this set, if
I

49
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:12,030
want to draw a picture of it looks like
this.

50
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,040
[COUGH]

51
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,050
And so what do I have next?
So it

52
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,364
turns out that the points here's.
This

53
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:28,473
point at the bottom is, let's see, what
did I

54
00:03:28,473 --> 00:03:33,577
do?
dx last, so this has this point at the

55
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:38,428
left most side of the green region in the

56
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:43,573
x coordinate is one, then I get this point

57
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:48,476
here, oh oops.
Not 1, it's

58
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:53,552
the square root of 2 over 2, then this
point is going to

59
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:58,580
be 1.
And so that makes sense, because y equals

60
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,828
x gives me the point 1 equals 1, and y
equals 1 over x also gives me the point

61
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:07,057
1 equals 1.
So this bottom point of the green

62
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:07,462
[COUGH]

63
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:12,740
green region is the point 1,1.
This point over here is root 2 over 2.

64
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,814
And so you just find those by figuring out

65
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:17,510
where each of these lines intersects the
other one.

66
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,743
And then on the right hand side I guess we
get root 2.

67
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,990
And, it turns out that we're pretty lucky.

68
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,853
That this point at the very top of

69
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,855
the green region, too, also has x
coordinate 1.

70
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,160
So, it's exactly above this bottom point.

71
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,932
And, so the reason that that's going to be
handy is that means that

72
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:42,160
instead of having to split this up into a
whole bunch of pieces.

73
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,040
I can just split it up into two pieces.

74
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,480
So I can go from the leftmost endpoint,
which was root 2 over 2, up to 1.

75
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,944
And I'm going to

76
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:54,890
kind of try and get this bit over here.
Oh, I could have used another color.

77
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,600
And then I want to go from 1.

78
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,380
So that's kind of this line dividing the
green region in half up to root 2.

79
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,330
And that's going to be my second integral,
but the point is

80
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,950
in the first integral, given x, I can find
an upper bound.

81
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,968
So, I can find an upper limit and a lower
limit as functions

82
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:19,140
g of x, so g one of x and g two of x.
So, the upper limit, given

83
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,858
x, will be 2x, and the lower limit will be
one over x.

84
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:28,903
Then, when I'm on the right hand side of
the x equals 1 line, the upper limit

85
00:05:28,903 --> 00:05:35,041
will be 2 over x, so that's this line up
here, and the lower limit will just be

86
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:41,238
x.
So y equals x, and so those,

87
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:47,046
I guess, are the limits that

88
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:52,128
I've plugged in here and

89
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:57,977
here, and here, and here.

90
00:05:57,977 --> 00:06:02,057
So, I think the rest, most of this slide,
you can tell it's going to be

91
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:06,640
bad because I didn't have enough space to
even put the, the title up at the top.

92
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,259
I needed, you know, more space to put the
calculations.

93
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,288
You can actually evaluate this it just
sort of

94
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:17,660
becomes an exercise in bookkeeping which I
did for you.

95
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,300
So, just to point out some good habits.

96
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,330
So, first I'm going to integrate with
respect to y.

97
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,767
So that means my limits have to be y
equals functions of x and so

98
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:35,290
then when I, once I find an anti
derivative.

99
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:41,330
So when I integrate x with respect to y
that's going to come from the function xy.

100
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,180
If I took the derivative of that, the
partial derivative of

101
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,389
xy with respect to y that would just give
me x.

102
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,361
And then just to remind myself which
direction

103
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:53,776
I'm going, I said I'm going to evaluate

104
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:57,990
that at y equals 2x and then 1 equals 1
over x and take the difference.

105
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,036
And then I'm going to do the same thing
for

106
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:02,330
my integral on the right hand side as
well.

107
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,930
And so at this first step I get the same
antiderivative.

108
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,774
I don't suppose I can make that go away.
Maybe if I click

109
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:17,708
on details and then quit.

110
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,840
We are going to have to edit this out of
the video I think.

111
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,260
Okay, good.

112
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,300
So hopefully I don't get some terrible
virus in the next 12 minutes.

113
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,314
So in the first step we're going to get
the first

114
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:40,850
anti-derivative, but once I evaluate this
at the limit, so

115
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,774
the, the limits in the y direction are
different in

116
00:07:43,774 --> 00:07:47,198
the first integral than they are in the
second integral.

117
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:49,402
So I'm going to have a different integral
when I

118
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,780
come to doing the second step of my
interation.

119
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,381
And so this is what I end up with, an
integral

120
00:07:56,381 --> 00:08:00,000
from root 2 over 2 to one of 2x square
minus 1.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,370
And then the integral from 1 to root 2 of
2 minus x squared.

122
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,076
Now it's just a regular old single
variable problem, so you can

123
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:13,750
look through the slide on your own time if
you want to.

124
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,040
Just trust that I did it correctly.

125
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,659
Again, big exercise in bookkeeping, but if
you don't

126
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:23,047
make any sign mistakes you will eventually
arrive at

127
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:28,670
the correct answer, which is this minus 6
plus 5 times the square root of 2 over 3.

128
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,016
And so just let's keep that

129
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:34,010
in mind.
So minus 6 plus 5 root 2 over 3.

130
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:40,070
And now let's consider the change of
variables.

131
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,940
So s equals xy, and t equals y over x.
So, hopefully seems familiar.

132
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,630
This was my domain in, for the original
integral.

133
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,594
And it turns out, if I define these
variables this way, it's

134
00:08:57,594 --> 00:09:02,560
actually pretty easy to figure out what
the, the transformed domain should be.

135
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,103
So here I have x y has to be in between 1
and 2.

136
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,170
So that's going to tell me that s has to
be in between 1

137
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,024
and 2, and then t is equal to y over x, so
this just tells

138
00:09:15,024 --> 00:09:17,990
me that t also has to be in between 1 and
2.

139
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,990
So instead of having this funny shaped
green interval now,

140
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,112
I just have a square 1, 2 cross 1, 2.

141
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,010
So that's my new domain of integration,
omega.

142
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,850
And you can sort of use the same reasoning
that I used to, with the diamond.

143
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:45,940
So here if we look at t, is this y over x.
So if I were to solve this.

144
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,450
For x I would get y equals t times x.

145
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,520
So that's saying t is kind of the slope of
that line.

146
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,160
And if you think about what's happening in
this blue region,

147
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,200
t equals 1 corresponds to the bottom of
the blue region.

148
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,130
And t equals 2 corresponds to the top of
the blue region.

149
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,220
Just because here I have y equals 1 times
x.

150
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,030
Up to y equals 2 times x.

151
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,045
And in between 1 and 2 if I had t equals 3
over 2 times

152
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:18,500
x, that would just be a line that split
the blue region right down the middle.

153
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,300
So you can sort of think of it as this
bottom line swinging up to the top line.

154
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,424
So it's pivoting on the origin, just from.
y equals x up to y

155
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:33,930
equals two x and then the same thing for
this s equals xy.

156
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:39,078
I could think of that as y equals s over
x, and so again there's

157
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:43,731
this number 1 going up to 2, oops, going
up to 2, so s

158
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:48,384
equals one just corresponds to the bottom
of this yellow

159
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:53,930
region, the curve making the bottom of the
yellow region.

160
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,758
And that curve is just going to shift up
to the top as s goes from 1 to 2.

161
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,798
So that's sort of the geometric argument,
you know making this

162
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:07,550
sketch of the domain is usually what
you'll have to do.

163
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,385
It turned out this wasn't quite as hard as
I thought it

164
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:13,472
would be the first time I read it, just
because, I realize

165
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,929
now the reason that the, the textbook
defined

166
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:18,930
the, defined this domain in such a
complicated way.

167
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,210
Is because it makes it easy to see what
the limits

168
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,148
on s and t are going to be just because
this

169
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:25,314
is really telling you what the limit of s
is and

170
00:11:25,314 --> 00:11:27,740
this is really telling you what the limit
of t is.

171
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,098
And so that means I can change my domain
from d, which is this funny shaped

172
00:11:36,098 --> 00:11:42,290
green thing, to just t equals 1 to t
equals 2 and s equals 1 to s equals 2.

173
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,883
But then I need to use my change of

174
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:46,400
variables formula to figure out what I
need here.

175
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,290
And so first, to do that we have to do
what the, the quiz question was last time.

176
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:59,340
So I came up with the, the change x equals
the square root of s over t.

177
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,920
And y equals the square root of s times t.

178
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,320
And then, I calculated the partial
derivatives for the change of variables.

179
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,230
So I got, 1 over 2 times the square root
of st.

180
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:18,350
Square root of t divided by 2 times the
square root of st.

181
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,810
Square root of s.

182
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,248
Oh, so, minus the square root of s divided
by 2t to the

183
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:28,610
3 halves, but I wrote that as t times the
square root of t.

184
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,280
And then, square root of s divided by 2
times the square root of t, so.

185
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,994
For me, I, I put this here just because I
think it looks a little

186
00:12:38,994 --> 00:12:41,918
prettier, but in terms of doing the
calculation,

187
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:44,450
I find this, this formula far more useful.

188
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,457
So these are actually the things I would
plug

189
00:12:49,457 --> 00:12:52,630
into, that I would plug into the Jacobian
formula.

190
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,394
And these, you know, if I write my
transformations like this, then I can just

191
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:03,200
use the power rule to figure out what's
going on to take the partial derivatives.

192
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,293
And so the Jacobian for this particular
change of variables just becomes this,

193
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:15,000
and if you cancel everything out so you
can see it's kind of constructed.

194
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,679
So stuff cancels out nicely, so the square
root of t will

195
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,330
cancel out this square root of t, square
root of s cancels out.

196
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,000
This, square root of s.

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,930
And so in both cases, we just get 1 over 2
times the square root of t.

198
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,490
Sorry, 1 over 2 times the square root of t
squared.

199
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:39,920
So I get 1 over 4t times 1 over 4t, and
that's one over 2t.

200
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,790
Okay, at least one person got the right
answer on the quiz.

201
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,540
So now I can plug this into my change of
variables formula.

202
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,364
So, this was the original integral over
the funny-shaped domain d.

203
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,370
And now I've already worked out what the
new domain, omega, is.

204
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,390
It's just the square 1,2 to 1,2.

205
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,561
I have my function is x and my change of
variables was

206
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:16,380
x is equal to the square root of s divided
by t.

207
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,790
So this is, oops see if I can.
The square root here is just x.

208
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,476
Then, the absolute value of my Jacobian

209
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:26,930
is 1 over 2 times t.

210
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,518
And since I defined x and y to be greater
than 0, that

211
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:38,890
was part of the definition of my domain,
then, the Jacobian, so t.

212
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,250
Is this function of x and y, but it's
going to be positive

213
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,930
only when x and y, or it's positive when x
and y are positive.

214
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:51,490
So the absolute values, they're kind of
invisibly here, but not necessary.

215
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,600
And then I can change this into an
integral, ds dt.

216
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,600
And so now I just have to integrate.
This function, instead of just x.

217
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,460
But at least the, the limits are quite a
lot easier this time.

218
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,694
So instead of having these complicated
limits for for

219
00:15:10,694 --> 00:15:13,350
the first integral, I now just have 1 and
2.

220
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:20,650
And so again, it's just sort of two single
variable problems one after the other.

221
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,747
And again, I like to write it in this form
here, so I can see

222
00:15:28,747 --> 00:15:34,360
clearly how the power rule or the
anti-power rule are working.

223
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,543
And so the rest of it's just sort of an
exercise

224
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:41,630
in keeping track of signs and not screwing
up too much.

225
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,916
And, once we get to the end, I end up with
the same value, so last time

226
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,581
I had negative 6 plus 5 root 2 over 3.

227
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:56,641
the only thing that changed here is
somehow my negative 6 being ended

228
00:15:56,641 --> 00:16:01,020
up second but we get the same answer so
that's a pretty good affirmation.
