1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,520
The last lesson in this set is

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,509
Marginal Density of a Bivariate Normal
Distribution.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,370
So this was actually one of the integrals
that

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,220
motivated me to have this class in the
first

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,720
place because I gave this in Introductory
Statistics class

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,660
to people who haven't done Calculus for
quite some time.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,700
And pretty much everybody fell flat on
their face.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,600
So hopefully if we go through this one
time, I want to just point out some of

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,930
the tricks that pop up quite often when

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:40,098
we're integrating probability distribution
function, probability density functions.

11
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:44,114
And this a reasonably complicated and
useful example.

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,450
So if you thought the Black-Scholes
formula was difficult

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:50,475
[LAUGH]

14
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:55,490
this, this one is it's got the same number
of

15
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:01,480
variables but they have Greek names or at
least five of them have Greek names.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,790
And so I think that makes people think
it's more complicated.

17
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,830
For the model I want to use, we can
simplify it a bit.

18
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,430
So it, what I would want to use this for,
its

19
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,370
a, for two random variables but

20
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,780
rather than being independent, they're
correlated.

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,750
And so this last argument that I have here
is a correlation coefficient.

22
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,710
When it's positive, it just means if first
random variable so if,

23
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:32,000
if x were large and I could observe that
before observing y

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,160
then I would expect y to be large as well.

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,450
If it were zero, then knowing the value of

26
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,930
x wouldn't tell me anything about the
value of y.

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,060
And if it were negative, then if I knew I
had a large

28
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,060
value of x, that would lead me to expect a
small value of y.

29
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,550
If I want to use this in a financial

30
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,610
application, the, the mu, these are sort
of expected values.

31
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,800
So there would be expected return.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,100
And I, if I were using this for a

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,970
single asset, I would sort of say that the
expected

34
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,780
return in this period is probably going to
be

35
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,460
the same as this expected return in the
next period.

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,280
And then these sigma x and sigma y are

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,070
thought of as the, the risk of owning that
asset.

38
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,690
So the sigma x would be the risk in the
first

39
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,060
period, sigma y would be the risk in the
second period.

40
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,010
If the periods are next to each other and
reasonably short, then

41
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,920
you can also get away with just assuming
that that's the same.

42
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,720
So I'm going to rewrite this with

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,660
sigma x equals sigma y just equals sigma
and mu x equals mu y just equals mu.

44
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,190
And that'll at least make this fraction in
the right-hand side drop down one level.

45
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,750
Because I'll be able to take this, this
sigma x squared will be

46
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,010
the same as this product, sigma x sigma y,
and the same as this.

47
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,700
So I'll be able to write that just down
here.

48
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,280
And

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,470
then, the thing that I'm trying to compute
is called a marginal density.

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,930
So this is the density, you know, in

51
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,360
theory I have these two variables that are
somehow

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,050
behaving together, but if I don't, if I'm
in

53
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,570
a position where I can't see the other
variable.

54
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,990
So suppose I don't pay attention to what
happened on

55
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,250
the, during the first period and I just
wonder what's

56
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,610
going to happen in the second period,
that's the marginal density.

57
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:35,080
So, if I don't care about x and I just say
what, what's the best you can tell

58
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,740
me about y given that I'm choosing to
ignore

59
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:43,080
x, you end up with this thing called
marginal density.

60
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,630
And you get that just by integrating one
of the variables out.

61
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,250
So if I take a functions of x and y and I
integrate it from negative infinity to

62
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,770
infinity with respect to x, I'm going to
be left with this partial integral.

63
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,920
It's going to be a function of y and
that's going

64
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,070
to be called in probability and
statistics, the marginal density of y.

65
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,030
For our, for, you know, for this course,
I'm just doing one partial integral.

66
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,390
So let's see.

67
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,660
So that was my, my example was, oops, x

68
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,570
and y were returns on an asset in
consecutive periods.

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,335
And then the simplification I'm going to
make is that

70
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:24,470
the expected return on the asset is the
same in

71
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,450
each period and the risk that I'm taking
on by

72
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,190
investing on that asset during that period
is the same.

73
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,590
So I only have one mu and one sigma.

74
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,444
And so, I can almost force this onto one
slide.

75
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:44,825
So the, oh, oops, if I've done it the
other way around.

76
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:46,970
Yes.

77
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,710
So on the first slide, I said I was

78
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,740
going to get the marginal density with
respect to y.

79
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,600
Here, I'm doing the same thing with
respect to x but it's

80
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,470
exactly the same operation since it's
symmetric with respect to x and y.

81
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:08,452
So what I want to do is integrate this big
ugly bivariate

82
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:13,750
density function from minus infinity to
infinity with respect to y.

83
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,980
And one of the nice things to that,

84
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,640
I said this was the normal probability
density function.

85
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,750
It has this nice property that most of the
time when you

86
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,350
do things to it, the answer is a normal
probability density function.

87
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,810
So, a good first step and this happens
quite often, you can

88
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,070
usually make a pretty good guess as to
what the answer should be.

89
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,030
or you can at least guess, you know, what
it

90
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,140
should be if it's going to be easy to do.

91
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,020
you might try that and find out it doesn't
work

92
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,720
and then it's not going to be easy to do.

93
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,850
but in this particular case, I'm just
going to

94
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:57,600
guess that the marginal density is just a
univariate.

95
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:01,600
so this is the, the same, you know, phi
function.

96
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,130
It's just been scaled by a factor sigma
and shifted by a factor mu, but this

97
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,650
is a normal probability density function.

98
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,910
And so here, since I'm, oops, since I'm

99
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,430
integrating with respect to y, everything
in this

100
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,530
marginal density with respect to x is
going

101
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,810
to be constant with respect to this
integration.

102
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,040
So what I'm going to do is factor all of
that stuff out

103
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,400
of here, move it outs, oops, move it
outside of my integral sign.

104
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,790
Because if, if it's constant with respect
to y, it can cross the integral sign.

105
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,330
And then look at what's left, and hope
that

106
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,510
that's something I can figure out how to
integrate.

107
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:54,500
So, the idea is that I will end up with
this marginal density.

108
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,240
My guess at what the marginal density

109
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,900
function should be, times everything
that's left.

110
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:06,140
So, this C here is, this, this thing here
with

111
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,880
the 1 over square root of 2 pi sigma
factored out.

112
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,572
I just couldn't fit everything into the
slide if I did it.

113
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:13,720
And then, I have all of

114
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,425
this stuff left over.
And so I need to somehow show that this

115
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:25,120
integral from minus infinity to infinity,
this big ugly mess, dy is equal to 1.

116
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,030
And so this is, this is what this value of
C is equal to.

117
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:34,630
So it's if you multiply this by C, you
just

118
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,165
get the scaling factor from the, from the
bivariate density function.

119
00:07:39,165 --> 00:07:44,839
>> Can we go back over this real quick

120
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:44,845
[INAUDIBLE]?

121
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:45,375
>> Yep.

122
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:49,396
>> I'm sorry, so you're taking your
guess for

123
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:49,404
[INAUDIBLE]

124
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:52,930
would be and multiply it by what we have
up above?

125
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,820
Is that what's going on?

126
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,740
>> So, what I've done, I've taken this
term here or this factor

127
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,130
here and I've split it up into this and
this.

128
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,600
Alright, so if I multiply those together,
I get this thing back.

129
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,460
And then, this is what I want to appear
outside.

130
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,010
Oh, and again, this should be an x.

131
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,720
It should be the same as this, just with
the opposite sign.

132
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,910
and so if I have a negative 1 here and a
positive 1 here, that would be e to the 0.

133
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,340
So it's basically what I've just done, is
multiplied this

134
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,231
thing by 1, but used a, a clever choice of
1.

135
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:40,279
>> Thank you.

136
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,810
>> Okay.

137
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,860
So now what I want to do is look at the
part that's in the

138
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,000
square brackets, so if I go back,

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,510
I'm looking at this, this square brackets
here.

140
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,230
I just, I want to simplify that.

141
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,200
So, this is the bit in the square
brackets.

142
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,430
If I wanted to do this subtraction, then
I've got 2 sigma squared in the

143
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,260
denominator here and 2 sigma squared times

144
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,500
1 minus rho squared in the denominator
here.

145
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,570
So I need to multiply those first term by

146
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,220
1 minus rho squared over 1 minus rho
squared.

147
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,720
So if I do that, then I can put everything
over a common denominator.

148
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,240
And I have 1 minus rho squared times x
minus mu squared.

149
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,360
And then, what I had originally.

150
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:35,140
And if you look at this carefully, I have
1 times x minus mu squared

151
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,990
minus x minus mu squared.
So this 1 is going to disappear.

152
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,350
This whole term is going to disappear and
what will be

153
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,890
left is negative rho squared times x minus
mu squared.

154
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,255
So let's hope that that's what I've done
in the next step.

155
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:51,160
Yep.

156
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,056
So I have negative rho squared times the
quantity x minus mu squared.

157
00:09:55,056 --> 00:10:01,730
I have everything else still staying the
same here.

158
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,400
And let's see, what have I done?

159
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,100
So now I multiplied the numerator by
negative 1 and then I'm

160
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,824
going to cancel that out by multiplying
the whole fraction also by negative 1.

161
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,960
So that made my first term positive,
second term negative, third term positive.

162
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,390
And if you stare at this for a while, it
should start to look familiar.

163
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,150
So if

164
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,740
you think back to the Completing the

165
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,680
Square Lecture, you'll actually realize
that this

166
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,420
is already in the, the right form, it
could be written as something squared.

167
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:51,116
And that something is just going to be rho
x

168
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:58,701
sorry, rho x times the quantity x minus mu
minus y minus mu squared or

169
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,950
sorry, minus y minus mu.

170
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,430
Hopefully I'll get it right when I hit the
Next key.

171
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,580
So I have rho times x minus mu.
When I square that, I'm going to get this.

172
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:20,410
Then I have minus y minus mu.
When I square that, I'm going to get this.

173
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,270
And then the cross terms are going to be
rho x minus

174
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,780
mu y minus mu with a negative sign in
front of it.

175
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,290
I'm going to get two of those from the
outer and from the inner,

176
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,649
and so that's where this middle term is
coming from or going, I guess.

177
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:39,940
Okay.

178
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,300
And then I'm going to write this.

179
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,110
So it's exactly the same thing, I've

180
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,280
just sort of rearranged where I'm putting
parenthesis.

181
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,330
So I have y

182
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,670
minus something and that something is mu
plus rho times x minus mu.

183
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,313
So all I've done here, I had a, a rho
times

184
00:12:06,313 --> 00:12:11,250
x, sorry, a rho times x minus mu and a
minus y.

185
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:17,430
so I did something that's a bit a bit
clever here.

186
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,730
Since this is squared, I can multiply the
inside by negative 1.

187
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:28,570
So I can actually write this as y minus
mu, minus rho times x minus mu.

188
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,790
And when I square that, the negative 1
will go away.

189
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:38,176
So it'll be negative 1 squared times the
product here.

190
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:39,060
So that lets

191
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,470
me put this term in front.
And this term, second.

192
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:49,250
So I end up with this y, oops, minus this
mu.

193
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,590
So this mu here becomes this mu here.

194
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,300
Then, I have minus rho times x minus mu
but since I'm writing it in these

195
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,360
parenthesis here, that minus has to be a

196
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,270
plus because that minus is going over
here.

197
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,330
So, I end up with mu

198
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,485
plus rho times x minus mu.

199
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,609
So, that's mostly just an exercise in
bookkeeping for science.

200
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,770
And then in the denominator, I'm going to

201
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,680
write sigma squared times 1 minus rho
squared.

202
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,650
As sigma times the square root of 1 minus

203
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,130
rho, I'll put that all in parentheses and
square that.

204
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,410
And now if you look closely at what this

205
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:37,280
is, this is a variable minus a constant
squared

206
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,930
over 2 times another constant squared.

207
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,670
And now I'm going to plug this back into
my square brackets here.

208
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:58,810
So this is what we had at the end of, you
know, two slides ago.

209
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,920
This was the thing where I said, I want to
show that this integral is equal to 1.

210
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,420
And

211
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,190
I want to look just at the integrand so

212
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,260
that's the C times the thing in the square
brackets.

213
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,300
So on the previous slide I found another

214
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,440
expression for what's in the square
brackets here.

215
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,150
And that's, I've plugged in here.

216
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:28,100
And then in my C constant, I'm going to do
the same thing I did I'm going to write

217
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,550
the sigma times the square root of 1 minus
rho squared in parenthesis.

218
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,715
And now this constant here is equal to
this constant here.

219
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:41,081
And if you think back to what did

220
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:44,721
the standard norm or what did the normal
density

221
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:49,271
function look like, in the original one
this was called sigma.

222
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:53,800
I just had a 2 sigma squared over in the
exponential part of the function.

223
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,210
And I had a 1 over square root of 2pi
times sigma.

224
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,990
So this is just a new value for a sigma.

225
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:09,597
And then the numerator of the exponential
part, I have y minus mu squared and so

226
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:16,650
now, I just had y minus something but it's
I'm integrating with respect to y.

227
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,810
And this doesn't have any ys in it, so
that's effectively a constant.

228
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,960
So this is actually a normal probability
density function,

229
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,390
just with a different mean and a different
standard deviation.

230
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:33,740
So this, this term down here is the
standard deviation.

231
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:40,390
And this, this term here is the mean.
And so, if I let m

232
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,318
equal this guy here, which is that.
And I let

233
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:53,615
s equal sigma times the square root of one
minus rho squared, which is that.

234
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:58,870
And when I plug those in, I end up with 1
over the square root of

235
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,060
2 pi times s e to the minus y minus m
squared

236
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,320
over 2s squared.
And this is exactly the normal

237
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,330
density with mean m and then standard
deviation s.

238
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,840
And so if I integrate this, so I'm
integrating

239
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,540
this with respect to y from minus infinity
to infinity.

240
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,607
I know it's a density function so this is,
this is

241
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:33,660
sort of the big trick because I don't
actually have to do

242
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,330
the integral if I can show that it's a
density function

243
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,390
because I know every density function is
going to integrate to 1.

244
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:40,890
So

245
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,230
the integral of this normal density over
the entire real

246
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,000
line, so from minus infinity to infinity
is equal to 1.

247
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,290
And so now if I go back to, so this was
my, my big ugly formula.

248
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,140
I've just been simplifying and simplifying
the integral.

249
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:05,610
And now I have it oops, looks like the dy
disappeared off the end of the slide.

250
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,520
but the integral of this density

251
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,200
over the entire real line is equal to 1.
So, I get that my

252
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,480
marginal density was equal to 1 over the
square root of 2 pi sigma.

253
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,720
This is just the thing that I guessed and
factored out at the beginning.

254
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,600
oops, so, it looks like I switched the xs
and ys again, so this should be an x.

255
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,330
so x minus mu squared divided by 2 sigma
squared.

256
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:42,923
So I get that the marginal density of x is
also a a normal distribution.
