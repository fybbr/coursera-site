1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,300
Then next topic is going to be something
called Fubini's Theorem.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,400
So first of all, I'd like to say, I just
think, if you have

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,090
a name this neat, it's really good that
you attach it to a theorem.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,230
So it's just sort of, for me anyway it's
fun to say.

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:17,230
>>

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:17,230
[LAUGH]

7
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:17,230
>>

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,520
[COUGH]

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,680
And so this function, so remember my big
question

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,640
at the end of the last set of slides.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,290
If f of x is continuous on the rectangle R
equals a,b cross c,d

12
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:38,370
so it's just between a and b on the x-axis
and between c and d on the y-axis.

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,630
Then Fubini's theorem tells me that the
double integral over that

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,420
region over that rectangle is equal to,
and I can do it either

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,070
dy dx so I can, it's equal to the value of
iterated integral.

16
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,870
And it doesn't matter which way I do the
iterated integrals

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,200
so if I do this dy dx or I do dx dy.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,370
And so remember, we have to be a bit
careful that the ab corresponds

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,940
to the dx, so they have to be on the
inside or on the outside,

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,140
but you can't mix.
And here, the ab corresponds to the dx.

21
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,370
So, the order of iteration does not
matter.

22
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,440
And so in this particular case, when I'm
talking about a rectangle, it's

23
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,180
not going to make too big a deal which way
you do this first.

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,050
Later on, you're going to find that you
look at

25
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,162
a, a region, it's not always going to be
defined

26
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:33,100
just as, you know, this is a, this is b,

27
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,210
there's going to be functions that give
you the region too.

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,446
For instance, if you wanted to integrate
over a triangle or

29
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:42,730
a circle or something like that.

30
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,530
And it's going to be a lot easier
generally to do dy dx or dx dy.

31
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,400
So one of them is either going to be very
difficult or impossible.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,760
I mean, they both might be very difficult
or impossible.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,718
But sometimes one is very difficult and
the other one is relatively easy.

34
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,480
And so just, just for your own sanity, I
would recommend doing it the easy way.

35
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,190
So, one of the things I like to do when

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,240
I have a theorem like that is just test it
out.

37
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,398
So, let's try an example and see what
happens.

38
00:02:14,398 --> 00:02:21,010
So, I'm going to define the rectangle to
be 1, 3 cross 2, 5 so this

39
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,500
is just in between 1 and 3 on the x-axis
and in between 2 and 5 on the y-axis.

40
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,360
My function will be 2y minus 3x and I
want to compute the double integral

41
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,410
over that rectangle.

42
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,540
So using Fubini's theorem, I can say that
this double

43
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,060
integral is going to be equal to the
iterated integral.

44
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,340
And so in this case, I'll integrate with
respect to

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,360
x first, and then I'll integrate with
respect to y.

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,520
So again the 1, 3 is here and that's my x
limits so I have to do dx

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,080
first if the 1 and 3 are in here and then
2 and 5 are the limits corresponding to y.

48
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,800
And so, the way I'm going to do this

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,112
inside integral now, I'm integrating with
respect to x.

50
00:03:09,112 --> 00:03:12,694
So, I'm just going to pretend like y is a
constant.

51
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:15,760
And then I can treat this just as a single
variable integral.

52
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,980
So the first term, this is just a constant
times dx.

53
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,300
So by the anti-Power Rule all that's going
to happen when

54
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,310
I take the antiderivative of that, just an
x shows up.

55
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,240
And if I were to take the partial
derivative of this term with respect

56
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,560
to x, I would just get 2y, which is
exactly what I started out with.

57
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,450
The second term, the minus 3,

58
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,280
minus 3x that's the derivative of minus 3x
squared

59
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,740
so if I take the derivative again, partial
derivative with

60
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,610
respect to x but it's easier to miss that,
it's

61
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,800
a partial derivative because there's no y
in this term.

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,590
I would take 2 times 3 half to the the,
times

63
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,040
x to the 2 minus 1 which would just be 3x.

64
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,540
And

65
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,660
now, I can evaluate this at the limits.

66
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:14,150
So I guess I was a bit lazy when I wrote
the limits here but once I've done

67
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,340
this, there's no more dx in here to tell

68
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,748
me what variable I've integrated with
respect to 2.

69
00:04:20,748 --> 00:04:24,640
So with 2 it's not too bad, but we can use
the

70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,740
same idea of iteration to do triple
integrals, quadruple integrals, and so on.

71
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,657
So, it's probably a good habit to

72
00:04:30,657 --> 00:04:32,929
remember that this is x equals 3 as the

73
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:35,627
upper limit and x equals 1 as the bottom
limit.

74
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:38,041
But otherwise, I do it exactly the same
way

75
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:42,019
that I would've done using the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus.

76
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:47,225
So the value of this integral is just the
antiderivative evaluated at the upper

77
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:53,090
limit minus the antiderivative evaluated
at the lower limit.

78
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,310
This thing is the antiderivative,

79
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,830
so all I'm going to do is put in 3 for x
in the first term and

80
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,330
then minus and then substitute 1 for x in
the second term.

81
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,840
And so now, I've integrated out the x,
there's no longer an x in here

82
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,900
but there still are some ys, and so this
is now my, my partial integral.

83
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,860
So it's now a function of y that I

84
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,860
can integrate in the second step with
respect to y.

85
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,360
First though I think I probably simplified
it because

86
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,920
addition is going to make this a little
bit prettier.

87
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,560
So it turns out that's just equal to 4y
minus 12.

88
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,700
And so then this is something we should be
reasonably

89
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,850
familiar with now so I'll just go through
this quickly.

90
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,460
So, I get the antiderivative evaluated at
the top

91
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,250
limit and subtract the evaluation at the
bottom limit.

92
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,080
And so that gives me 50 minus 60,

93
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,090
so that's negative 10 minus 8 minus 24.
So tricky again, I know

94
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,240
some of us don't like signs and pluses but
that's minus 10 minus negative 16 which is

95
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,400
equal to 6.
So, in this case, I did the integral.

96
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,150
I iterated with the dx integral first and
then the dy integral.

97
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,980
And so let's try that again.

98
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,430
But this time, I'm going to do dy first.

99
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,700
So I had to, I switched the, switched the
dy and dx.

100
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,400
And then I also had to switch the two
integral signs.

101
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,858
So the, now that the inside limits, the 2
and

102
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:30,960
the 2, these correspond to Integration
with respect to y.

103
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,440
And the 1 and the 3, the outside

104
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,200
integral corresponds to integration with
respect to x.

105
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,622
So again, just to use the anti-Power Rule,
2y is the

106
00:06:43,622 --> 00:06:50,370
anti or 2y is the derivative of y squared
and then 3x

107
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,826
is going to be constant with respect to y.
So that just becomes 3xy.

108
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:59,380
And then again, I'll just evaluate this at
y equals 5 and

109
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,610
I evaluate it at y equals 2 and I take the
difference.

110
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,065
So this is the, the function evaluated
when y is equal to

111
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:10,750
5 and this is the function evaluated when
y is equal to 2.

112
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:16,100
And now I just have a function, the y is
entirely gone.

113
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,130
So I have a function of only x and

114
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,760
I'm going to integrate that function from
1 to 3.

115
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,790
So first I'll do some simplification.
And then the antiderivative is

116
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,870
trivial again just with the, the Power
Rule.

117
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,170
So I get 21x minus 9 halves x squared from
1 to 3,

118
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,780
so I evaluate this at 3, I evaluate at 1,
take the difference.

119
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,340
And so it's a, a little bit less pretty
this time but if I have 63

120
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,840
minus 21 that gives me 42.

121
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,970
Then I have negative 81 over 2 and then

122
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,390
minus, minus 9 over 2.
So it's the same as negative 81 plus 9

123
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:09,790
over 2, which is 72 over 2, which is 36
and so I have minus

124
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,410
36 and again I get 6.

125
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,420
And just for people who weren't paying
attention on the last slide, that's the

126
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,460
same answer we got when we did the
integral iterated on the other direction.

127
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,995
So, that's a, a pretty good check.

128
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:23,220
If I have a, a simple function, at least

129
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,130
it works and this actually does work in
general.

130
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,080
So you don't need to check it but I just
wanted to go through a, a little example.

131
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,210
Okay so the next thing, we might want to
do, so, so

132
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,740
far I've just talked about doing a double
integral over a rectangular region.

133
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,000
but now suppose instead of a rectangle, I
want to

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,640
have a more general region that I'm
going to call D.

135
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,130
So I've, I've, I think on the first set of
slides I called the area

136
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,140
in the x,y plane that I was integrating

137
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,740
above, I called that the domain of
integration.

138
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,270
So that's why I chose D here, it just
means domain.

139
00:08:59,680 --> 00:08:59,770
And

140
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,220
I'm going to write this using a set
notation, so these

141
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,250
little squiggly brackets this means I'm
talking about a set.

142
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,530
And set is just a rule to say something is
in the set or something is not in the set.

143
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:20,550
And so the way you read this is, the set
consists of points x,y

144
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,640
that satisfy x has to be in between a and
b and

145
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:32,360
then y has to be in between a function of
x and another function of x.

146
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,610
So there's some function of x on the
bottom and some function of x on the top.

147
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:47,620
And so for a rectangle g1 of x was just
equal to c and g2 of x was equal to d.

148
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,360
And now this is just letting me have a, a
slightly more general region.

149
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,950
So I could have an upward-sloping line and
then that could

150
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,560
be either a trapezoid or a triangle, or
something like that.

151
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,170
And so then when I do my iterated
integral, I don't really

152
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,950
have the freedom to do it dx dy or dy dx
anymore.

153
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,160
So in this case, I have to do the dx last

154
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:16,390
because those are where I have the
constants in in the limits.

155
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:26,490
So if I find an antiderivative of f of
x,y, I'm going to evaluate

156
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:33,140
it at y equals some function of x and
again at y equals this lower bound of x.

157
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,576
So after I've done this inside integral,
I'm going to have a function of x alone

158
00:10:38,576 --> 00:10:44,930
and then that's going to be something I
can integrate in my second integral.

159
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,100
But the, the limits on the last integral

160
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,776
always have to be real numbers otherwise,
you

161
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:54,620
know, there's no way for me to integrate
if I had a, a function of y here.

162
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,290
And when I did my antiderivative and then
plugged in my function of y, I would

163
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,800
still have a function of both x and

164
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,729
y so it wouldn't be an iterated integral
anymore.

165
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,840
And so this is kind of, this is what I was
getting at when I said sometimes it's

166
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:16,690
easier or impossible to do an integral you
know, dx dy or dy dx.

167
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,770
You can actually draw a picture of what
this region

168
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:25,320
looks like And if it's bounded both
directions you'll always be

169
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,430
able to find a way to describe that as a

170
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,670
to b with a function making the top and
another function

171
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,280
making the bottom.

172
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,910
Or you could think of it as, you know, c
to d with

173
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,140
one function making the left side and one
function making the right side.

174
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,610
And one of those might be easier to do
than the other.

175
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,190
So I think there's an example in the

176
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,420
homework of, of how this will work out,
where

177
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,310
one of the limits is basically what you

178
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,745
need to be able to do integration by
substitution in the outside integral.

179
00:11:56,745 --> 00:12:05,710
Okay.
And so this is just the other possibility.

180
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,290
So d can either have x having the real
limit.

181
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,060
So x between a and b and then y between
functions

182
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:20,930
of x or you can have y between c and d and
then have x in between functions of y.

183
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,760
And so all that happens here is you just
have to integrate.

184
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,480
So here I do dy dx first and here I have
to do dx dy first.

185
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:45,340
So we might see something like this.
So, if I say x plus y, so

186
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:51,440
absolute value of x plus absolute value of
y has to be less than or equal to 1.

187
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,180
So, this describes a, a diamond that just
has corners at

188
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,820
0 plus or minus 1 and plus or minus 1, 0.

189
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:04,030
So, it's usually helpful to draw a picture
of what this looks like.

190
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,650
Even if it's not

191
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,930
a very good picture, it will still help
you figure out which way

192
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,570
is going to be easier whether you want to
do x first or y first.

193
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,510
And then, this is a, a useful check just
to

194
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,890
make sure you've done things first in, in
getting your region.

195
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:26,020
So if I have, if I define my function, the
integral of f of x,y just to be constant

196
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,730
1 over the entire domain then when I
integrate

197
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,030
that, I'm just going to get the area of my
domain.

198
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,890
So if I have a, an area and I multiplied
it

199
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,745
by one to get a volume then that volume is
just

200
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:40,850
going to be equal to the area.

201
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,100
So my double integral over this diamond,

202
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:56,360
I can write that just as 1 dA.
And now this is a bit tricky

203
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,580
so, it's a good example though of how you
can split up an integral.

204
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,790
So I'm going to integrate with respect to
x last so

205
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,700
that means that the x limits get to be
real numbers.

206
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,680
And conceptually, what I want to do is I
want to

207
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,585
start at negative 1 here and go over to
positive 1.

208
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:25,130
And just like I could break up the, the
interval into two sub-intervals.

209
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,730
So two integrals that together make the

210
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,060
full interval for a single variable
integration problem.

211
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,530
I can split up the domain into pieces so

212
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,650
that all of those pieces together make the
entire domain.

213
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,560
And so what I'm going to do is this
function

214
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,430
will be much easier to define if it
doesn't have this

215
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,290
sharp right-hand corner at the top.
same with the one on the bottom.

216
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:55,680
So I'm going to integrate from negative 1
to zero and then from zero to positive 1.

217
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,970
And then my limits for y are at a certain
value of x.

218
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,480
I'm going to go from, this is actually
negative 1 plus x.

219
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,710
So negative 1 minus x is the point down
here.

220
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,450
So if x were

221
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,610
equal to negative 1 half, then y would
equal negative 1 half as well.

222
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,010
And so, what I want to do is just set up
a, a function.

223
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:24,450
So the, the limits here, minus 1 minus x
and 1 plus x given

224
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,220
x, just tell me how far it is from down
here to up here.

225
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,500
And then, the functions are slightly
different on

226
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,630
the right-hand side, the, the slope just
changes.

227
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:34,810
So

228
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:39,000
I have just where I had plus x over here,
I'm going to end

229
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,050
up with minus x over here and the same in
the, in the bottom.

230
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,252
And then all that I have to do is start my
iterated integral.

231
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,910
So the integral of 1 with respect to y,

232
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,830
that's just going to be the derivative of
y.

233
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,590
So I end up with y evaluated at the

234
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,260
top limit minus y evaluated at the bottom
limit.

235
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,350
So what I'm going to do when I evaluate
this now,

236
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,590
I'm going to stick in 1 plus x for y and

237
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,494
so, and then the same thing for the, for
the right-hand integral.

238
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,950
And so what I end up with is, top limit
minus

239
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,580
bottom limit for the, for the integral on
the left term.

240
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,220
And then top limit minus bottom limit

241
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,340
for the integral that's the, the
right-hand term.

242
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:34,580
And then I go ahead and simplify that.

243
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,840
So I get 2 plus 2x and 2 minus 2x.

244
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,130
But now, I have two single variable
integration problems.

245
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,790
And again, they're pretty easy.
So just use the Power Rule backwards.

246
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,390
And we get 1 plus 1 which is 2 and I guess
I'll flip back to this.

247
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,520
So if I were to take this triangle in the
bottom

248
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,180
right side and put it up here, then I'd
have a square.

249
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,930
And if I took this one and put it up here
I'd have another square.

250
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,870
So that would be a rectangle, these two
squares.

251
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,380
So it'd be width 2 and height 1.

252
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,280
So the area of this shape should be equal
to

253
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:17,400
two.

254
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,888
And that's what we got when we did our
integral.

255
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:26,498
So everything is working out so far.
Oh, and I guess I should

256
00:17:26,498 --> 00:17:31,802
mention, so in the first slide

257
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:37,769
when I put Fubini's Theorem up, I

258
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:43,800
said that it was over a rectangle.
