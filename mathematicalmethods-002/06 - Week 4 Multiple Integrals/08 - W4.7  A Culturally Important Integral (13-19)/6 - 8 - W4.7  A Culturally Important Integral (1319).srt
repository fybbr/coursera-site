1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,280
Lesson 7 is A Culturally Important
Integral.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,490
So the first time I saw this integral, the
professor who taught

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,100
me how to evaluate this called it an A
Culturally Important Integral.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,198
I think it's taken probably ten years but
now I, I fully agree with him.

5
00:00:19,198 --> 00:00:23,470
So, hopefully if it doesn't seem all that
culturally important to

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,450
you after a few years of experience and
I'll improve a bit.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:33,350
So, I'm going to look at a function called
the standard normal density.

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,560
This is the little phi that's been showing

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,450
up in the, in the Black-Scholes Pricing
Formula.

10
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,090
And it's defined to be 1 over the square
root

11
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,380
of 2 pi e to the minus x squared over two.

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:55,887
And we also, oops, so little phi is not
actually in the Black-Scholes Pricing

13
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:59,160
Formula, it's this capital phi that's in
the Black-Scholes Pricing Formula.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,480
I guess this showed up in the in the

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,268
homework when we were looking at the
derivatives of the

16
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:10,500
Black-Scholes Pricing Formula.
The capital phi is

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,810
defined as the integral from minus
infinity up to x of little phi of t dt.

18
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,690
And so when I saw this the first

19
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,210
time, now a few questions immediately
popped into mind.

20
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,330
So I, I called this 2 and a half.

21
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,070
So where does the 1 over the square roots
of 2 pi come from, that

22
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,660
just seem sort of like a strange thing to
stick in front of a function here.

23
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,640
Two, why not use a closed-form expression
for this capital phi?

24
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:45,181
And so it turns out

25
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:49,508
this is a function that somebody actually
proved does not have,

26
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:54,030
so this function here, someone has proved
this does not have antiderivative.

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,592
So there is no way to write down

28
00:01:56,592 --> 00:01:59,734
a closed-form expression for this function
capital phi,

29
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:01,814
by closed form, I just mean, you know,

30
00:02:01,814 --> 00:02:04,910
like 1 minus the square root of something
else.

31
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,605
They gives you the value of this capital
phi function.

32
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:10,230
If you wanted to write down the

33
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,960
function, you would have to keep just
writing and writing.

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,620
You need an infinite number of terms in
order to write it down.

35
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,180
And so then, the 2 and a half question was
where did this 1 over 2 pi come

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,550
from because the whole reason it's here is
that

37
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,450
I want this to be a probability density
function?

38
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,925
So the different, part of one of the
conditions,

39
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,330
but there are two conditions, it has to be
greater

40
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,120
than zero, greater than or equal to zero
for all real numbers.

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,730
So this satisfies that.

42
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,940
It's actually greater than zero for all
real numbers.

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,420
And it has to integrate to one when

44
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,850
I integrate it from minus infinity to
infinity.

45
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,560
And so the reason this 1 over the square
root of 2 pi is

46
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,220
here is because this function here
integrates to the square root of 2 pi.

47
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,750
So, if I wanted to integrate to one, I
need to divide by 1

48
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,100
over the square root of 2 pi, so those
will cancel each other out.

49
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,972
And when I do this integral, I'll have 1.

50
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:14,240
But, yeah?
>> I know this is a weird question

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,560
but if I don't have a closed-form
expression for big phi how do we know

52
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,760
when we integrate it from negative
infinity to infinity that it's equal to 1?

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,350
>> Well, big phi doesn't have that
property.

54
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,810
The little one, the little one does.

55
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,590
And so that's actually what this whole
lesson will be about.

56
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:41,620
So, kind of, in particular, I need to know
exactly what you just asked.

57
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,460
If I knew the, the capital phi if I could
write

58
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,970
down that function and just take the limit
as it goes to

59
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,770
negative infinity and the limit as it goes
to positive infinity,

60
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,700
then I would be able to evaluate the area
under that curve.

61
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,920
And I would be able to tell you

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,000
you know, I'd be able to tell you what it
is, I'd

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,660
be able to tell you that's the square root
of 2 pi.

64
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,070
Then I would say well if that is the
square root of 2 pi, if

65
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:11,130
I divide by the square root of 2 pi,
that'll make it equal to 1.

66
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,450
And so the rest of this lesson is to find

67
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,130
out where this square root of 2 pi comes
from.

68
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,560
So, since phi is a probability density
function, the

69
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,590
integral of phi over the real line, so I
don't

70
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,450
know why I put it twice here but it still
integrates to 1 even if you do it twice.

71
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,610
And this implies that e to the minus x
squared over

72
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,750
2 dx has to equal the square root of 2 pi.

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,262
And you can make a change of variables to

74
00:04:48,262 --> 00:04:50,830
just have a, a slightly simpler version of
the

75
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,850
function without the squared minus x
squared divided by

76
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,740
2 just to have e to the minus x squared.

77
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,650
And so this is actually what I'm going to
try and show.

78
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,520
That the integral of e to the minus x
squared from

79
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,360
minus infinity to infinity is equal to the
square root of pi.

80
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,800
And like I said before if e to the minus

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,950
x squared over 2 doesn't have an
antiderivative, then this

82
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,480
isn't going to either because I was able
to get

83
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,460
this with just a simple change of just a
simple substitution.

84
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,080
So this is actually going to use a trick
very similar to what we used in

85
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,320
the very first lesson, when I was trying
to come up with the value of an annuity.

86
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,270
I'm going to pretend like I know what the
answer

87
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,350
is and say that it's equal to the value of
this

88
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,570
definite integral on the right-hand side
and that I'm going

89
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,480
to mess around with this m as well as the
integral.

90
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,100
So I want to show that m is equal to the
square root of 2 pi.

91
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,820
And I could also write m as the integral
from minus

92
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,100
infinity to infinity of e to the minus y
squared dy.

93
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,410
So it doesn't matter what I call my
variable.

94
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,230
The value of this integral is going to be
the same.

95
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,010
So I'm going to have m defined in terms of
x and m

96
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,270
defined in terms of y but they're going to
be the same number.

97
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,970
And now what I'd like to do is to show
that M squared is equal to pi.

98
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,250
So if I can show that M squared is equal
to pi then that is

99
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,110
the same thing as showing that M is equal
to the square root of pi.

100
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:40,280
And if you recall the Separable Integral
Lesson, so this now looks

101
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,330
like what I would want to get from a
function that's separable.

102
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,720
But I can use that result backwards as
well, so I, I'm going

103
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,450
to start out by just trying to unseparate
this and see what happens.

104
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,160
So that's just the double integral of a
separable function.

105
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,460
And I'll start unseparating the integral.

106
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,030
So there's M squared again and

107
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,190
then I'll take the, let's see, so I've
taken the y integral and

108
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,270
kind of plucked it into here, which I can
do because it's a constant.

109
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,630
And then I'll get rid of my, my brackets.

110
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,960
And now, notice that e to the minus x,
oops, e to the minus

111
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,470
x squared, that's also a constant with

112
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,770
respect to this integral on the right-hand
side.

113
00:07:33,868 --> 00:07:37,790
And it looks like my dx disappeared from
this line, but it showed up again here.

114
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,090
So, everything is okay.

115
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,300
And so what I'm going to end up with is e
to

116
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,230
the minus x squared times e to the minus y
squared.

117
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,800
And by the properties of the exponential
function, I can write

118
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,170
that as e to the minus quantity x squared
plus y squared.

119
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,630
And then when you see x squared plus y
squared, that's usually a pretty good

120
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,560
hint that this might be something that

121
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,230
would be simplified by switching to polar
coordinates.

122
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,218
So, let's see what happens when I try and
switch this into polar coordinates.

123
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:16,834
so all I have to do to switch to

124
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:23,152
polar coordinates, I replace the

125
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:30,940
x by r cosine theta and the y by r sin
theta.

126
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,614
And then, my dx dy becomes r dr d theta.
So, the r was the Jacobian.

127
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:43,380
If I use the same transformation, if I use
the same change of variables

128
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,600
over and over and over again, the Jacobian
is always going to be the same.

129
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,544
So for the change to polar coordinates,

130
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:54,598
the dy dx or dx dy is always going to
become r dr d theta.

131
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,950
So now, I can write my M squared as the
integral from zero to 2 pi integral from

132
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:11,040
zero to infinity of, well, this guy is
going to get easier in just a second.

133
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,140
So, let's,

134
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:21,030
so all I've done here is I've factored out
the r squares the negative r squared.

135
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,538
And what's left inside the square brackets
here

136
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:27,600
is cosine squared theta plus sin squared
theta.

137
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,370
This is equal to 1.

138
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,850
So I have e to the minus r squared.
And then luckily, this little r that

139
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:40,470
showed up, thanks to the Jacobian, is
exactly what I need to be able to do a

140
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,630
substitution, to be able to integrate e to
the minus r squared.

141
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,470
And again, this is separable, so I can
also

142
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,580
take advantage of the fact that there's no
theta

143
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,910
in this part of the function so I can

144
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,550
move the integral with respect to theta
out in front.

145
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,260
And then, I have minus 1 half that I'm
going to introduce here just

146
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,814
so I can introduce some minus 2 here, so
minus 2 will cancel out the minus 1

147
00:10:12,814 --> 00:10:18,030
half.
If I make the substitution, u equals minus

148
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:23,290
r squared then du is going to be

149
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,610
minus 2r dr.
So, I've made this, put this in,

150
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,640
in brackets here.

151
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,640
So, I have e to the u after I make my u
substitution.

152
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,180
This bit in the, in the parentheses is
going to be du.

153
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,120
And then if u is equal to minus r squared,
the limits on

154
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,170
u, they're going to start at 0 because
negative 0 squared is still 0.

155
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,370
And it will go to u equals negative
infinity.

156
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,568
The first first integral is trivial so
that just becomes theta

157
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:04,710
integrate evaluated at two pi so this will
just be two pi.

158
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:12,120
This is, oops, this is e to the u du.

159
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,780
So that's a special function that it's a,
it's its own derivative.

160
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:21,410
So I end up with minus 1 half e to the u
evaluated at minus infinity and at 0.

161
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:21,910
And so,

162
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,840
I have to be a little bit careful here.
I can't just plug infinity in.

163
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,260
But what I end up having is minus 1 half
so

164
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,690
e to the, I'm going to replace u with t so
this

165
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,490
is just e to the u evaluated at t and then

166
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,150
take the limit as that go, as t goes to
minus infinity.

167
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,820
And then, I have to subtract the lower
endpoint.

168
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,040
So that's just going to be e to the u with
u equals zero substituted in.

169
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,830
That will be e to the 0, and anything to
the zero

170
00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:00,930
power is equal to 1.
Or anything not 0 to the 0 power is equal

171
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:07,270
to 1.
So then I have minus 1 half

172
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:14,070
times this, the limit as, of e to the t as
t goes to negative infinity.

173
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,853
This is if I, it gets smaller and smaller.
So in the limit that's just going to be 0.

174
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,720
So I end up with 0 minus 1, so negative

175
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,350
1 times negative 1 half, and that gives me
a half.

176
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,880
This first bit is 2 pi so 1 half times 2
pi gives me pi.

177
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,540
And I've been writing all of these equal
signs here.

178
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,760
So the whole long string of e qualities is

179
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,980
showing me that M squared is eventually
equal to pi.

180
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,410
And this is the thing that I set out to
prove in the first place.

181
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:55,000
So, in summary, I started out with M equal
to this integral

182
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,570
that I couldn't find an antiderivative of.
So it was difficult to evaluate.

183
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,137
I was showed I was able to show that M
squared was

184
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:09,500
equal to pi so M is equal to the square
root of pi.

185
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,430
And that gives us the result that we

186
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,980
wanted, that this integral from minus
infinity to

187
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,720
infinity of e to the minus x squared dx is
equal to the square root of pi.
