1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,300
Next up is polar coordinates.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,420
So this is going to be last, last time

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,960
we talked about, change of variables for
double integrals.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,400
And then I gave you one sort of contrived
change of variables, just

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,450
to show how you could change a very
funny-looking domain into a nice square.

6
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:25,410
another useful change of variables is

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,680
to change into something called polar
coordinates.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,900
And so in the xy plane I think everybody's
familiar with describing a point as

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,860
an x value comma y value, but that's not
the only way you could do it.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,650
And in polar coordinates, we're going to
describe points, so I'm

11
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,680
calling that xy plane this funny shaped or
funny drawn r squared.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,160
And that just means, you know, I have a
real number

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,280
on the x axis and a real number on the y
axis.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,710
So it's giving me coordinates in the xy
plane.

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,780
But instead of using x and y, I'm going to
describe them as a distance

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,185
r from the origin, and then an angle theta
from the positive

17
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:14,830
x-axis.

18
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:18,675
So angle theta is angle counterclockwise
from the, the positive

19
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:25,320
x-axis, and then the way you'll move
between x and y coordinates and

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,430
polar coordinates or, if I know what r and
theta are.

21
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,370
Then I can recover the x coordinate by
evaluating r cosine

22
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,400
theta, and I can recover the y coordinate
by evaluating r sin theta.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,400
I think, I have a picture.
So if I

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,481
have a point x0 y0, in x

25
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:56,820
y coordinates I would call it x0 y0, in
polar coordinates I'm going to call it r0.

26
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,810
So it's the length of this dotted line
here, away from the origin.

27
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,670
And then it has, it makes an angle theta
0, with a positive x axis.

28
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,600
And then if you just drop the line

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,730
down here, you'll see that makes a right
triangle.

30
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,650
So if I, if I take

31
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,230
a line parallel to the y axis, that goes
through the point x naught y naught, I'll

32
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,980
end up with a right triangle.
And the height of that triangle

33
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,700
is going to be one of the legs of that
right triangle, and so the definition

34
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,050
of the sign of an angle is this leg

35
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,980
divided by.
The and by the hypotenuse, and I know

36
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,850
the hypotenuse is r zero, r naught.

37
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,430
So, that's how I can recover the x
coordinate, using r, whoops sorry,

38
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,310
y coordinate, using r assigned data.

39
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,650
And then the same thing is going to happen
for the x coordinate.

40
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,150
So, I have this right triangle.

41
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:06,290
The bottom leg is just the ratio of that
length

42
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,400
to the hypotenuse so that length divided
by r naught.

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,130
That's the cosine of theta, and so that's
how I'm going to recover my x coordinate.

44
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,690
So, for any point in the x-y plane,
there's one way of writing it as x comma

45
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,580
y and one equivalent way of writing it as
r

46
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,310
comma theta except for one point, which is
the origin.

47
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,640
And that's a little bit trickier in polar
coordinates, because if

48
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,120
I have r equals 0, I can have theta equal
anything.

49
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,770
So there's you know, there's an infinite
number

50
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,930
of ways to describe the origin in polar
coordinates.

51
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,050
But it turns out that in practice that's

52
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,800
just because it's only occurring at one

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,330
point, that doesn't cause too many
problems.

54
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,410
So the change of variables when I want to
move from,

55
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,100
from xy coordinates to polar coordinates,
I've defined it this way.

56
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,710
And so the partial derivatives of this
change of variables

57
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,750
are going to be, so I have to have dx, dr.

58
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,660
there'll be four of them.

59
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,262
So, dx, dr, and dx, d theta, and then dy,
dr, dy, d, theta.

60
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:27,600
So, dx dr, that's an easy one to take the
derivative of.

61
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,650
Dx d theta, so the derivative of cosine is

62
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,400
negative sine, so I just end up with
negative

63
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,290
r sine theta.

64
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,960
Dy dr is just going to be sine theta, and
then the derivative of sine is

65
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,200
cosine, don't need to change the sine for
that one so I end up with r cosine theta.

66
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,360
The Jacobian is then going to be so it's

67
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,290
dx, dr, dy, d theta, so cosine theta times
r cos theta.

68
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,670
So that gives me, that'll be r cos squared
theta.

69
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,880
And then I'm going to subtract the partial
of x with respect to theta.

70
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,350
So that was minus r sin theta times sin
theta,

71
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,870
and hopefully you sort of see where this
is going now.

72
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,500
So I can factor an r out of this whole
thing.

73
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,610
And I'm left with r times the

74
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,840
quantity cosine squared theta plus sine
squared theta

75
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,025
and this quantity is equal to 1.

76
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,800
So I end up with the Jacobian just being
r.

77
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,270
And then, because I've defined r as a
distance from the point

78
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,960
to the origin, I know it's going to be
greater than 0.

79
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,460
So when I stick, I, it simplifies things.

80
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,430
I don't have to worry about taking the
absolute value of the Jacobian.

81
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,130
So I can change an integral that's given
to me in terms

82
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:06,760
of x and y into an integral in terms of r
and theta.

83
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,310
So I just replace the x coordinate with r
cosine theta.

84
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,670
I replace the y with r sine theta.
I have to multiply by the absolute value

85
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:21,600
of the Jacobian, and then that, oops, that
changes it into an integral in terms of

86
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,720
r and theta rather than x and y.

87
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,470
And the only tricky part then is the
domain of integration.

88
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,130
If I consider the xy plane, you know, the

89
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,710
domain of integration is going to be the
same shape.

90
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,350
But I'm going to have to describe that
differently, because

91
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,630
it's going to be Very different, in terms,
when i have

92
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,190
to describe that in terms of R in theta
than it

93
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,606
is when I'm describing it in terms of X
and Y.

94
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:56,000
So, some easy domains.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,510
So, in this case, I, I've written D zero
comma R,

96
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,970
and by this I just mean a disk of radius R
centered at the origin.

97
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,940
So this 0 is the center and R is the
radius of the disk.

98
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,650
And so this is going to be something
that's very easy to describe

99
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,650
in polar coordinates but there was more
difficult to describe in xy coordinate.

100
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,530
So this is the, this is the shape I was

101
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,910
getting at when I would do something like
integrate x from

102
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,790
minus 1 to 1.

103
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:32,450
And then I'd integrate y from the negative
square root of 1

104
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,590
minus x squared to the positive square
root of 1 minus x squared.

105
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,790
That would be describing the same region,
but

106
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,690
it's something that I can describe very
easy.

107
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:46,450
So it's just 0 to r.
And then 0 to 2 pi, in polar coordinates.

108
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,671
but it's a much more difficult description
when I'm working with x and y coordinates.

109
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:57,255
And then another useful trick for using

110
00:07:57,255 --> 00:08:02,500
polar coordinates is if I'm talking

111
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,577
about the entire plane, so this would

112
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:12,360
be the equivalent of integrating.

113
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,848
Here I've written this, again kind of
funny r squared to

114
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:18,790
mean the entire xy plane.

115
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,040
If I wrote this as an iterated integral it
would minus infinity to

116
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,060
infinity for the dy and then minus
infinity to infinity for the dx.

117
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,500
And so this is the kind of integral I
would be doing if you're taking 461 when

118
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,480
you're, when you're computing expected
values so you would

119
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,600
often have to integrate over the entire
real line.

120
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,930
If it's a probability density function

121
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:47,340
of two variables, then you have to
integrate over the entire plane.

122
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,490
And so you can integrate over the entire
plane in polar coordinates

123
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,750
by integrating the radius, so the r
variable, from 0 to infinity.

124
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,140
And then integrating the theta variable,
from 0 to 2 pi.

125
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,060
Oh, and that I, I pointed out that

126
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,240
this would be useful for integrating
probability density functions.

127
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,403
So for example, suppose I have a disk of
radius 1.

128
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,570
So since its radius is 1, technically the
equation of the circle is x

129
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,700
squared plus y squared equals r squared,
but for 1 I can omit the squared.

130
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,410
And then if I make it less than or equal
to 1, then I'm

131
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,770
talking about any point that's on the
circle or closer to the origin than that.

132
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,719
So that gives me a disc,

133
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,570
and I want to compute the integral one

134
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,140
minus x squared minus y squared, over this
region.

135
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,830
So if I try to do this using xy
coordinates,

136
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,030
I think this is one of those examples I've
done

137
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,040
a couple times before where I'm going to
go a

138
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,980
little ways and just say This is way to
difficult.

139
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,750
I need to try something different.

140
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,090
Let's see what ends up happening.

141
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,730
So I'll try once using xy coordinates and
then

142
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,140
I'll try once again after switching to
polar coordinates.

143
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,520
So you can tell it's bad again when I need
so much

144
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,820
space on the slide that I can't even fit
the title here.

145
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,610
But you can see how I've, I've set it up.

146
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:31,370
So, for the outside variable, and it
doesn't matter which one I

147
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,900
use in this particular case cause I'm, I'm
working with a circle.

148
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,530
But I decided to do,

149
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,162
oops, I decided to do negative 1 to 1 in
the x direction.

150
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:44,990
And then the y direction, oops, will just
be

151
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,450
minus the square root of 1 minus x
squared.

152
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,690
So that's from the bottom of the circle to
the positive square root

153
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,180
of 1 minus x squared which is up to the
top of the circle.

154
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,930
And then I put my, my integrand in here.

155
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,700
Oh yeah.

156
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:04,820
>>

157
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:04,820
[CROSSTALK]

158
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,830
from minus one to one, where does the
minus one come from?

159
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,880
>> So a circle that's at the origin and

160
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,350
radius one, what is the left-most point
that I'm

161
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,430
going to, if I go one away from the

162
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,810
origin in the negative direction, where do
I end up?

163
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,070
Right.

164
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,250
And if I go 1 in the positive direction, I
end up at positive 1.

165
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,760
So, that's, that's the, the region there.

166
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,880
And then the top and the bottom are

167
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,240
going to be curved, so that's why the
limits have to change.

168
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,230
So when I'm very close to negative 1, I
just have a little bit over here.

169
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,750
And then it gets bigger, and then smaller
again.

170
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,952
Okay, so, I started out by finding the

171
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:47,880
anti-derivative of the integrand, with
respect to y.

172
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,220
That wasn't too difficult.

173
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,430
The notation here, I treated 1 minus x
squared as a constant.

174
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,395
So when I integrated that, when I too the
anti-derivative of this bit that I have

175
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:01,820
highlighted, I just ended up with 1 minus

176
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,720
x squared times y, and then minus y
squared.

177
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,310
That's the derivative of minus y cubed
over 3.

178
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,640
And now I have to plug in my limits, but
my limits aren't, aren't very pretty.

179
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,750
So, once I plug that in, it actually
doesn't end up

180
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,430
being quite as bad as I, I thought it
would be.

181
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,020
So I'm going to end up with 1 minus, the
square root of 1 minus

182
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:32,700
x squared cubed in this term, and then I
have this 1 minus x squared

183
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,070
times the square root of 1 minus x
squared.

184
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,150
And I can think of this as the square root
of one minus x squared squared, so when I

185
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:48,190
do this product here, I have the same
thing here.

186
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:56,610
So, it simplifies a bit, so I ended up
with six times this thing cubed.

187
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:59,555
So the square root of 1 minus x squared
cubed minus 2.

188
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,510
So I have 4 3rds square root

189
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,050
of 1 minus x squared cubed.

190
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,010
and this is where I, I sort of got sick,
also

191
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,360
realized it wasn't going to fit on the
rest of the slide.

192
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,930
So I stuck it into Wolfram Alpha just to
see what it

193
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:22,830
would give me as the, as the correct you
know, exact answer.

194
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,160
So, this, this is my little dots saying
lots of work.

195
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,890
And you end up with

196
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,950
this which, you can actually.

197
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,250
It's so, you know, once you've done
something like

198
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,750
this with Wolfram Alpha, you know, this,
if it's

199
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,371
being evaluated from minus 1 to 1, it's
the

200
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:45,550
anti-derivative of this being evaluated
from minus 1 to 1.

201
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,890
So you should be able to take the

202
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,100
derivative of this and recover this
function here.

203
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,200
But even taking the derivative of

204
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,090
something this complicated doesn't look
like

205
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,340
very much fun.

206
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,020
Finding this as an anti derivative of some
other function will, would have been

207
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,960
quite a lot of work, so I'm glad a
computer could do that for me.

208
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,070
So the point is this was not very easy to
do if I left it in x,y coordinates.

209
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,750
So now let's try it again in polar
coordinates.

210
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,090
And so just from the first line, not only

211
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,220
is there a title on this slide, but
there's also

212
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,740
a reasonable amount of space above the
first line.

213
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,240
[COUGH]

214
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,750
So all I've done I have my d theta as my
outside integral.

215
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,690
So that's going to go from 0 to 2 pi
because I'm trying to describe a disk.

216
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,170
So to get all the way around something
round I have to

217
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,450
go from 0 to 2 pi And then the disc has
radius

218
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,570
one so the limits on my inside integral,
these correspond to the

219
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,590
dr integral, that's going to take r from
zero up to one.

220
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:59,850
Then, my integrand was 1 minus x squared
but I've replaced

221
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,870
x with r cosine theta, so that just
becomes r squared cosine squared theta.

222
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,430
And just, just to be perfectly clear, this
notation, cosine

223
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,550
squared, it means cosine of theta times
cosine of theta.

224
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,210
And then, similarly, for y.

225
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,490
Y was r sine theta, so I'm going to
replace

226
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,508
that, and y squared will become r-squared
sine-squared theta.

227
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:34,200
And then my Jacobian to turn dy dx into dr
d theta gives me this r here.

228
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,610
So rd rd theta.

229
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,110
And

230
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,008
now we can do a little bit of
simplification.

231
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:45,980
So this term, and this term, both have a r

232
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,750
squared in them, so I'm going to factor
that out.

233
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:54,040
Well, I'll factor out a minus r squared so
that's going to then leave me with

234
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:00,170
cosine squared plus sine squared, which I
already said was equal to 1.

235
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,630
So this whole thing that I have, have

236
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,440
highlighted right now, that's just going
to drop.

237
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,460
So I'll, I'll

238
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,490
end up with 1 minus r squared times rd rd
theta.

239
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,890
So the 1 times r became and r.

240
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,740
The minus t squared times r because this r
cubed.

241
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,090
And so all of a sudden, this is an
integrand

242
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,920
that looks like it's going to be very easy
to integrate.

243
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,960
And because there's no dependence on theta
inside

244
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,330
these square brackets, it's also a
separable function.

245
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,560
So let's see if I was smart enough to do

246
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,030
that.

247
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:46,090
No, not quite, but you can just evaluate
this inside the square brackets.

248
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,080
So I end up with r squared over 2 minus r
to

249
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,420
the 4th over 4 and the limits are now 0
and 1.

250
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,010
So, whenever you have something where
every term has

251
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,180
an r in it, it's always really nice to

252
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,260
see this at zero because it means that
when

253
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,430
I have the second part of the Fundamental
Theorem

254
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,875
of Calculus.

255
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:11,190
Anti-derivative at the top limit, minus
anti-derivative of the bottom limit.

256
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,700
This bottom one will just be 0, so

257
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,480
you don't have to bother doing that
subtraction.

258
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:25,510
So, I'll end up with one half minus 1 4th.
So I end up integrating 1 4th, so that

259
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:30,500
the value inside the square brackets here
becomes 1 over 4 and I'm integrating now

260
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,776
1 over 4 d theta from 0 to 2 pi.

261
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,650
And that's just going to be, if you, if
you think about

262
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,050
what this is going to look like in the r
theta plane.

263
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,300
I have a function that's height 1 quarter.

264
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,690
sorry, not the r theta plane.

265
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,810
That's with the theta axis and the, with
the function evaluated over that.

266
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:59,320
It's just a rectangle with type one
quarter, and with 2 pi.

267
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,874
So the, the integral of this is just going
to be 2 pi times

268
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:07,140
1 quarter, which will give me pi over 2 as
the value of that integral.
