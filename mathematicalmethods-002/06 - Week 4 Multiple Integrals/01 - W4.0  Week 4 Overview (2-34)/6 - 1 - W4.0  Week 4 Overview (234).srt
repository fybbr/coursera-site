1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,570
The topic for week 4 is Multiple
integrals.

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,730
So again I'm going to sort of follow the
same design I used in week two.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,260
I'll start off just by defining what a
multiple integral is.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,950
And because I want to be able to visualize

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,979
this, I'm just going to talk about double
integrals.

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,640
The second section is something called
Fubini's theorem.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,930
And this is sort of like the, the
fundamental theorem of calculus,

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,890
gave us a way to evaluate an integral, a
single variable integral.

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,300
Fubini's theorem allows

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,910
us to use something called an iterated
integral

11
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,100
to evaluate a double integral or a
multiple

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,130
integral In section three, I'll talk about
something

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,790
called the change of variables for double
integrals.

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,830
So this is if I want to substitute one of
my variables with an expression,

15
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,530
how I can modify my integral so that it's
still evaluates to the same number.

16
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,360
In section four, I'll just go through and
extend an example

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,860
of that.

18
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,900
And in section five, I will show you that
there

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,990
is a certain class of double integrals
that are called separable.

20
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:10,071
Where without actually doing anti, any
integration, you can separate them to two

21
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:13,818
single variable integrals, and that will
make the calculation a little bit easier.

22
00:01:13,818 --> 00:01:18,570
In section six, I will talk about one
particular

23
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,490
type of change of variables, which is
re-expressing the problem

24
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,746
in polar coordinates.

25
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:27,650
So, if the normal, if the original problem
was described in terms

26
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,130
of x and y, that would describe a point in
the plane.

27
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,670
Polar coordinates allows me to describe a
point in the plane using r and theta.

28
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,170
So r is a distance from the origin and

29
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,350
theta is an angle from the positive x
axis.

30
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,270
In section seven, I'll do something called
a culturally important integral.

31
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,165
So if you look at the standard normal
density, you'll notice there's this

32
00:01:51,165 --> 00:01:54,180
1 over the square root of 2 pi out in the
front of it.

33
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,909
And that's because I wanted to integrate
to one.

34
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,020
And so I want to go through the argument
for why the, the

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,660
normalization factor should be 1 over the
square root of 2 pi.

36
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,830
So that's what we'll,

37
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,650
that's what we'll cover in topic seven.

38
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,880
And then in topic eight, I want to work
through calculating

39
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,070
something called the marginal density of a
bi-variate normal distribution.

40
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,340
So this is actually just single partial
integration exercise,

41
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,040
but it's a very complicated integral to
look at.

42
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,040
But again, it has, there are some tricks
that makes it easier to evaluate, and so

43
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,890
I want to go through them once in class

44
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,670
just so you have the opportunity to see
them.
