1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,050
So, the next thing we're going to learn
about

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,630
is how to change variables in double
integrals.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:18,020
So changing variables, when we did this
in, in Week 2,

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,220
I just called this the substitution method
or integration by substitution.

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,330
And so I'm going to, just to do a, a quick
review of that.

6
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,530
So suppose that x is a continuous function

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,490
and then g of x is a continuously
differentiable and invertible function.

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,140
Differentiable, I think I even spelled it
right.

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,620
So continuously differential just mean I
can take its derivative and the derivative

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,340
is a continuous function.
Invertible means that if I say x

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,180
is equal to g of s, so I have an s, I use
g to get an x.

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,090
Then there's another function g inverse,
so that I can

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,900
take g inverse of x and get my s back.

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,370
And that has to give me the same s that I
started with.

15
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:06,870
So,

16
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,820
something like a linear function is
invertible, but if I

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,610
had a parabola, so if I had y equals x
squared.

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,270
If I gave you x is equal to negative 3,
then

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,922
my function would give you, so negative 3
squared would be 9.

20
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:29,430
B but then if I, if I looked at 9, I
couldn't tell you if you

21
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,020
started out with a negative 3 or a

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,710
positive 3, so that would be a
non-invertible function.

23
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,160
So the

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,610
key thing here for g of s is that I have
to be able to

25
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:43,080
go back to the, back to where I started
from, back to my original s.

26
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,200
So this implies that g of s

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,400
is either strictly increasing or strictly
decreasing.

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,010
Although I guess it could have a flat spot
but then it

29
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,830
would have to immediately pick up again
right after the flat spot.

30
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,580
and so what I'm going to use g of s to do
then

31
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,580
is to map an interval c, d into an
interval a, b.

32
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,810
So if I have a variable s that lives in an
interval c, d then

33
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:28,370
I can find x by evaluating g of s, and
that's going to give me a point in a, b.

34
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,051
And the way I want to set this up is x has
to be able to take every value in a,

35
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:33,240
b.

36
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,246
And for every value x in a, b, there's

37
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:40,700
g-inverse of x that gives me a value in
c,d.

38
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,600
And then the same property has to hold the
other direction.

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:51,020
So for every s in c, d, I have to be able
to get a g of s in a, b.

40
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,490
So that's a, sometimes you hear the phrase
one-to-one and onto.

41
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,470
So it means for every s, there's a unique
x and

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,428
everyone in this interval goes to one in
this interval.

43
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:09,900
So there's for every point in a, b, I can

44
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,860
find in s in c, d that gives me that
point.

45
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,610
And for every point in c, d, I can find an

46
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,660
x in a, b so that g-inverse gives me that
s.

47
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,230
So then, integration by substitution says
that I can then switch

48
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,960
switch variables here.
So, I started out having a function of x

49
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,580
and this gives me a rule for changing that
into a function of s so

50
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,640
that these two integrals, these two
definite

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,489
integrals are going to have the same
value.

52
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,680
And so now, change your variables in two
dimensions.

53
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,250
I'd want to do the same thing.

54
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,160
But now, I have functions that are in
well, functions of more than one variable.

55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,370
So let's let f of x, y be a continuous
function.

56
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,360
And I want to compute the double integral
over some domain D of f of x, y.

57
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,940
And so, when I was doing this in the
single variable case, I had

58
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,090
an integral a b for my first inter
interval a, b for my first integral.

59
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,150
And then I had an interval c, d

60
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,580
for the second integral, for the
transformed integral.

61
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:42,080
Now, I'm going to start out with an, a
domain D for the original integral.

62
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,410
And a domain

63
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,910
omega for the transformed integral.

64
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,740
And now, I just have to have two
functions.

65
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,220
So, I have a, a function x of s, t.

66
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:00,570
So, given s and t, this gives me a value x
and a function y of s, t.

67
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,950
So, given s and t, this gives me value y.

68
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,930
So, basically what I'm trying to do, I
have a 2-variable problem in x and y.

69
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,420
And I want to change it to two

70
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,200
different variables, s and t that are
functions so

71
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,120
that x and y are functions of s and t.

72
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,980
And then again, I need this relationship
to be one-to-one and onto.

73
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,450
That means for every point in omega, there
has to be a point in

74
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:33,560
d so that this relationship gives me gives
me the point in omega.

75
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,480
And then for every point

76
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,900
in D, there has to be a point in omega

77
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,700
so that this change of variables gives me
that point.

78
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,460
So it has to go backwards and forwards
giving

79
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,100
me, so I can always get my one point back.

80
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,410
And there has to be a one-to-one
correspondent so

81
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,130
one point in each interval corresponding
to the other.

82
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,866
And we also need this x of s, t and y of
s, t to be continuously differentiable.

83
00:05:57,866 --> 00:06:02,580
And so the,

84
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,150
the thing I just tried to describe so
every point

85
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,630
s, t, and omega has to correspond to a
point x, y and D and vice versa.

86
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,600
This is just a just a way of writing that
down.

87
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,170
So that's what this, that's what I mean by
this double arrow here.

88
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,130
And so now what I want to be able to do is

89
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,520
I want to be able to find a function h of
s, t.

90
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,590
So that if I integrate f of x, y dx dy
over the domain D, I get the same answer,

91
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:42,950
I get the same value as if I integrate h
of s, t ds dt over this new domain omega.

92
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,552
And so I want to think about this as fof
x, y is equal to f, oops,

93
00:06:54,552 --> 00:07:00,690
of x of s, t, y of s, t.

94
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,050
So basically I mean, this seems like a
sensible thing to do.

95
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,350
If I can get y in terms of s and t and I
can

96
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,180
get x in terms of s and t and I'll just
make my new function.

97
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,860
I'll write my function f of x, y as a
function of s and

98
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,330
t by first calculating x and y and then
plugging them in to f of x, y.

99
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,480
But we know this isn't going to get us all
the way, because this function of x and

100
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,390
y could be just 0 times y, in which case
it would just be a function of x.

101
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,840
And we already know that this does,
doesn't quite work for just

102
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,180
a function of x, I need to multiply it by
a derivative.

103
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,990
And so, we'll have to do some sort of
rescaling so

104
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,730
that we, we get the same value.

105
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:49,300
So in the single variable case, so if I
had x is equal to g of s then when I took

106
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,410
the derivative of both sides, I got dx is
equal

107
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,440
to g prime of s times ds, by the Chain
Rule.

108
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,240
And in the 2-variable case, I need to do

109
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,770
something analogous and unfortunately,
it's it's a bit more complicated.

110
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,590
So, it's complicated enough for even two
variables.

111
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,360
and you can just imagine what it's
going to look

112
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,100
like if you were trying to do three or
four.

113
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:16,310
[COUGH]

114
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:21,840
So in the 2-variable case, I have each
point x, y is a point, so

115
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,790
x of s, t, y of s, t.
And it's a vector-valued function.

116
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,240
So it has two inputs, s and t and it has
two outputs, x and y.

117
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,156
And so the gradient of this
transformation, so this two valued,

118
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:46,316
vector-valued function is going to be a
two by two array.

119
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:50,860
So remember, we used the notation capital
D for for the gradient.

120
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,170
And it's just the partial derivative of
the

121
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,880
first function with respect to s and t so

122
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,740
that makes up the top row of the gradient

123
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,610
and then the partial derivative of the
second function.

124
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,270
So the partial derivative of y of s t with
respect to s and then with respect to t.

125
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,110
So that becomes the second row of my
gradient.

126
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,960
So it's a two by two array containing all

127
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,304
of the first order partial derivatives of
a vector-valued function.

128
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,520
So then, the two-variable equivalent of
this operation here

129
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:40,108
is going to be dx dy equals and I take the
sort of the diagonals of this matrix.

130
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:42,060
So, I'm going to take the main diagonal
which

131
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,718
is this direction and then subtract the
other diagonal.

132
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:51,936
So it's the product of the main diagonal
minus the

133
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:56,816
product of the other diagonal so that's
just dx ds

134
00:09:56,816 --> 00:09:57,880
dy dt.

135
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,840
So, dx ds and dy dt so main diagonal

136
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,900
and then minus the product of the other
two terms.

137
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,610
So that's this thing in the, the square
brackets here.

138
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:16,630
And I'm going to take the absolute value
of that times ds dt.

139
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:21,600
And that's going to be, if I, if I
multiply, so when

140
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,060
I, when I make the change of variables so
I replace f of x, y with f of

141
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,132
x of s, t, y of s, t then I have to
replace the dx dy with

142
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,140
this thing on the right-hand side.

143
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,270
And then those two integrals are still
going to evaluate to the same real value.

144
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,060
And so then this quantity inside the
square brackets here, this is called

145
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,580
the Jacobian of the change of variables or
the Jacobian of the transformation.

146
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,220
And so that gives me this 2 dimensional
change of variables formula.

147
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,360
So my original integral was an integral
over a domain D, a double integral over a

148
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,800
domain d of f of x, y dx dy.

149
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,250
And then I can change that into a double
integral over a domain omega,

150
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,330
which is the, the same domain but
expressed in terms of s and

151
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,198
t rather than in terms of x and y.

152
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:26,010
Then, I'm going to evaluate my function at
x of s, t

153
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,700
and y of s, t multiplied by the absolute
value of the

154
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,604
Jacobian and then I can put ds dt here
rather than dx

155
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:38,329
dy I want to evaluate these two integrals,
I'll get the same number.

156
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,772
So, let's look at the example.
So here, I have my

157
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:53,140
domain is my diamond again so this is
absolute value of x

158
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,430
plus absolute value of y, it has to be
less than or equal to 1.

159
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,230
And I want to do the, the same integral
over again.

160
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,120
And so, this is what I did last time.

161
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,750
And so I'd, I'd integrated first with
respect to y and then with respect to x.

162
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,950
And so now, I'm going to consider changing
variables.

163
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:20,560
So instead of using x and y, I want to use
s and t and I'm going to define s

164
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,270
and t so that s is equal to x plus y and t
is equal to x minus y.

165
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:33,960
And then remember, I need to calculate
this Jacobian and also, well, in this

166
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:39,580
particular case, one doesn't depend too
much on the particular values of x and y.

167
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,210
But I'm going to need, in general, for a
function of x and y, I need to know what x

168
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:50,416
and are in terms of s and t so I have to
first solve for x and y.

169
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,130
So just a, a little bit of Algebra

170
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,440
and substitution will get you to these two
formulas.

171
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,840
Then I can compute the partial derivatives
of

172
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,020
all of these so everything is 1 half
except

173
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,590
for dy dt, which is going to be negative 1
half because it's a minus t here.

174
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,090
And

175
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,398
then I'll compute the Jacobian, so I have
the dx ds

176
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:20,768
dy dt so it's the product of the, the main
diagonal.

177
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:27,770
So that's 1 half times negative 1 half.
So dx ds is 1 half dy dt negative 1 half.

178
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:34,004
Then I'm going to subtract the product of
the other two terms so 1 half and 1 half.

179
00:13:34,004 --> 00:13:36,955
So that gives me negative 1 4th minus

180
00:13:36,955 --> 00:13:41,310
1 4th, which is equal to negative 1 half.
So the Jacobian of this particular

181
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:48,460
transformation s equals x plus y and t
equals x minus y is negative 1 half.

182
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,442
And then I can plug that into my original
integral.

183
00:13:55,442 --> 00:14:01,890
So my original integral was f of x, y
equals 1 over the domain D.

184
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:09,170
Then I can rewrite that as double integral
over a domain omega of

185
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:14,020
1 times the absolute value of the Jacobian
times ds dt.

186
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,940
And so the Jacobian was equal to negative
1 half.

187
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,320
The absolute

188
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,730
value of the Jacobian will be positive 1
half.

189
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:26,686
So, this gives me the double integral over
omega of 1 half ds dt.

190
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,750
So that's the easy part.

191
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,680
The tricky part now is what is this new
domain omega.

192
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:50,050
So I'm looking for values of s and t that
describe this diamond.

193
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,870
And these are the two functions I have.

194
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,130
So I have t is equal to x minus y and I
have s is equal to x plus y.

195
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:04,320
And so if I just, right now I'm going to
pretend they're 0 so t is 0 and s is 0.

196
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,230
And that just gets me y equals x, which is
this line here through the origin.

197
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,020
And x plus y or y equals minus x,

198
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,670
so that's just this line here through the
origin again.

199
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,920
So I have a line through the origin with
slope

200
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,370
1 and a line through the origin with slope
minus 1.

201
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,668
And now let's look at s equals x plus y
first.

202
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:31,520
So what's going to happen is I take
different values of s.

203
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,440
So in this, in this picture,

204
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,980
s is just going to be the y-intercept.
So by using larger values of

205
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:47,060
s, I'm just going to move this line up.
But the slope will stay the same.

206
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,830
And if I take negative values of s, that's
just going to move this line down.

207
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,220
But the slope is still going to be the
same because nothing's

208
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,150
changing on the right-hand side, which is
where the slope is determined.

209
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,810
And so if I want to cover this entire
rectangle with

210
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,900
s equals x plus y, I would want to go from
sort

211
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,540
of the, the line here, the x plus y line
that

212
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,490
gives me this side of the rectangle up to
the x

213
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,020
plus y line that gives me this side of the
rectangle.

214
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:20,550
And so that's going to correspond to the
y-intercept of this line here

215
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,374
is negative 1 and the y- intercept of this
line here is positive 1.

216
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,313
So s can range between negative 1 and

217
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:31,860
positive 1, and that just shifts this line
here

218
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:39,300
from this lower left edge of the diamond
up to the upper right edge of the diamond.

219
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,980
And then the same thing is going to happen
with t equals x minus y.

220
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,190
I want to go from negative 1 which will be
this lower right side of the

221
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,810
diamond up to positive 1 which will be the
upper right side of the diamond.

222
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,660
So the limit on

223
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,030
s and t are going to be minus 1 and
positive 1 for both variables.

224
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,200
So that gives me my domain of integration.

225
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,540
So it's now, I have taken this diamond
shape

226
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,870
in the original, in the original integral
and turned it

227
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,498
into a rectangle, in this, in this case a

228
00:17:08,498 --> 00:17:12,680
square so it'll be easier to to do the
integration.

229
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,760
And so this is what I had the first time

230
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,800
so I had to split the integral up into two
parts.

231
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,450
But if I decide to integrate in my, with
my change of variables now, I have an

232
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:32,120
integral over omega of just 1 half ds dt
but I can replace that.

233
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,410
So, I can use Fubini's Theorem again with
ds

234
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,490
and dt just like I could with dx and dy.

235
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,330
So, I could replace this dA with ds dt and

236
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,460
now it's going to be a lot easier because
the, the integrals for, sorry, limits for

237
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,420
s so the inside integral, they don't
depend anymore on, on t.

238
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,154
So here, I can just do this as a, a single
integration problem.

239
00:17:59,282 --> 00:18:03,110
And so just conceptually, what I'm going
to do is integrate 1 half over

240
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,369
minus 1, 1, so that's a rectangle of width
2 and height 1 half.

241
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,120
So that's going to give me 1 dt.

242
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,820
And now I'm trying to integrate 1 over the
interval minus 1 to 1.

243
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,880
So that's a rectangle of width 2 and
height 1.

244
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,210
So that just gives me 2 again.

245
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:29,220
And so, well to me, doing it this way was
a lot easier than doing it this way.

246
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,540
And we got the same answer.

247
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,740
So that's the idea of changing variables.

248
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,330
So the, the reason, let me make sure I
don't have another slide there, yeah.

249
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,880
So the reason you would want to change
variables are a, it's going to make

250
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,980
the integrand something that's easier to
integrate

251
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,510
or it's going to make the domain
something.

252
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,650
So if you can turn a odd shaped domain
into

253
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,950
a rectangle, that's going to make the
integration problem easier.

254
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,630
Or if you can,

255
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:02,660
by this change of variables, use the
Jacobian to introduce something

256
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,460
that you could then use in a, in a
substitution method.

257
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,920
you know, if you, if you want to use the

258
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,310
Chain Rule backwards you need the
derivative of your transformation.

259
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:15,660
And so sometimes you can use the, the
Jacobian to introduce that derivative of

260
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,630
your transformation and give your, give
yourself

261
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,320
an integrand that's easier to work with.
