1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,730
Okay, and now I think we have sort of the

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,730
the, tools we needed, to get to the the
important point.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,370
Which was differentiating improper
integrals.

4
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,830
So we're going to start out with a
function F.

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:29,370
That's continuous, and we're going to
assume that the integral of f over

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,920
the entire real number line, so integral
from minus infinity to infinity, exists.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,490
So, in particular, that means that it's
finite.

8
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,660
And now I want to consider a function b of
t.

9
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,940
Its a differentiable function and I am
going to

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,220
define a new function g of t which is

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:01:00,430
going to be the integral of my function f
from minus infinity up to b of t,

12
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,498
and I want to be able to compute g prime
of t.

13
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:14,150
And so so, sort of like taking the
derivative of a definite integral.

14
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,700
It's actually, doesn't end up being too
difficult.

15
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,930
So all we're going to do, because we
assumed that this integral

16
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,000
exists, that means that I can pick a point
somewhere in between.

17
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,450
And I can write g

18
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,900
of t as an integral from minus infinity up
to that

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,160
point plus the integral from that point up
to b of t.

20
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,840
And then because I'm free to choose that
point I might as

21
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,403
well choose something that's easy to work
with so I chose 0.

22
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,765
And so now I just want to take the
derivative of G of T, but

23
00:01:56,765 --> 00:02:02,140
since the first term,

24
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,780
so if I look at this closely now, this is
a, it's an indefinite integral.

25
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,280
So the integral from minus infinity up to
zero.

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,490
But there's no t's in this first term.
So as far as I'm concerned,

27
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:21,180
when I'm taking a derivative with respect
to the variable t, this is a constant.

28
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,340
And so, when I take the derivative of that

29
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,790
with respect to t, when I take its
derivative.

30
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,950
I'm just going to get zero.

31
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,740
So, to compute the derivative with respect
to t of my function

32
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,300
g of t, I can just ignore this first term
and all I

33
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,720
have to do is compute the derivative with
respect to t of the

34
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,879
integral from zero to b of t of my
function f of x.

35
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,960
But notice what happened now.

36
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,060
So the, the problem that we were trying to
deal

37
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,810
with is that we had an, we had an improper
integral.

38
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,470
But because of this the limits here are
both finite values.

39
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,460
So, this is integral that we already know
how to take the derivative of.

40
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,240
This is just a, take the, we use exactly
the same rule

41
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,292
I talked about in I guess it would be
number seven today.

42
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:19,260
How to take the derivative of a definite
integral.

43
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,020
And, on top of that, we're lucky that the
bottom is

44
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,700
zero so we only have to use half of the
formula.

45
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,960
So, g prime of t is just going to be the
derivative with respect to t of the

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,870
anti derivative of f evaluated at b of t

47
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,010
minus the anti derivative of f evaluated
at zero.

48
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,850
And this is just the result from
differentiating.

49
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,380
a definite integral.

50
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,040
So I know that that's f of b of t times
the derivative of b of t.

51
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,710
So f of b of t times b prime of t.

52
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,360
And then to do the same thing for the
lower limit.

53
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,780
Or we can do the same thing for the lower
limit.

54
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,410
So I'm just going to instead of g of t,
I'm going to have h of t, just exactly the

55
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,450
same thing, except that now it's my lower
limits

56
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,510
that's the function of t rather than the
upper limit,

57
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,010
[NOISE].

58
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,631
And so I'm still going to consider
integrating this function from a of t to

59
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:35,010
zero, and then adding on the integral from
zero to infinity.

60
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,450
And then when I take the derivative of
that, this

61
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,230
second term now is going to be the
constant, so that's

62
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,480
just going to go away so the, the answer
here

63
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,680
is just going to be the derivative of this
first term.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,410
And so the only difference we're going to
see, is just because

65
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,630
when I do this part of the fundamental
theorem of Calculus.

66
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,420
Now my function a of t is on the negative
side, so I get

67
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,980
the same answer as I got for the, for the
upper, limit being the function.

68
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,635
Except now it's just going to be minus.

69
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:16,080
F of a of t times a prime of t.
So now we have a, a very simple

70
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,220
rule for taking the derivative of an
indefinite integral.

71
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,250
And let's see if we can put that to work.

72
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:26,565
So,

73
00:05:26,565 --> 00:05:26,590
[NOISE]

74
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,780
I'm going to look at something called the
delta of a European Call Option.

75
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,280
That I'm going to price using the
Black-Scholes formula.

76
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,810
And so the Black-Scholes price, for a
European call option,

77
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,696
so this is the simplest possible one to
look at.

78
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:46,530
On a non-dividend paying asset, so this
could just be

79
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,842
a stock for instance, with a strike price
of 1.

80
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,160
Has a, a volatility of 20%, so this means
the volatility of

81
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,640
the returns on my asset, and I'm looking
at three months to maturity.

82
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,030
And so again, the reason I'm, I'm putting
all of these real numbers in

83
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,030
here is just because the Black-Scholes
pricing

84
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,540
formula, it's a function of several
variables.

85
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,200
I'm going to make it into a function of a
single

86
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,480
variable s which is the, the current price
of the asset,

87
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,540
just by plugging in actual numeric values
to all of the rest of the inputs.

88
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:25,120
And so this is the, the pricing formula.

89
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,900
So I have s.
Times this function phi, evaluated at d

90
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,320
1, minus e to the minus 0.01,

91
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,560
times this function phi again, evaluated
at d 2.

92
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,860
Where d 1 of S is just going to equal 10

93
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,270
times the log of the, the current stock
price, so 10 times the log of S.

94
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:58,990
Plus 0.015.
D2 of s is equal to d1 of s minus 0.1.

95
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,100
And this function phi.

96
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,820
So this is where the, all of the math
we've been doing

97
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,160
for the, for the last two lectures is
going to come into play.

98
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,760
This function phi.

99
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,950
Is defined as the integral.

100
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,650
So this is a, a capital phi, wherein the
font

101
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,120
I'm using, it's drawn just with a vertical
middle line.

102
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,080
The lowercase phi is its derivative, which
has a, a slightly slanted line.

103
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,990
So I'm going to integrate lowercase phi
from minus infinity up to z.

104
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,060
And lower case v this is probability
density function for a

105
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,020
standard normal distribution and this is
the mathematical formula it has.

106
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,640
So in order to calculate the price of my
European call

107
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,500
option, I am going to need to be able to
do mathematics.

108
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,240
With this function capital phi.

109
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,450
But this is a function that's sort of
famous

110
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,700
for not having an antiderivative.

111
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,800
So you can't actually write down a formula
for the value of this integral.

112
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,040
This is the simplest that I can write it
down.

113
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,340
So in order to actually price these
things, you have

114
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,380
to use a computer to approximate the value
of this integral.

115
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,930
But when we do mathematics with the
Black-Scholes formula,

116
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,110
we still want to be able to get analytical
results.

117
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,290
You know?

118
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,500
If, if I try to do everything numerically.

119
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,830
Then you run into problems of, you have to
be very careful of, you know?

120
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,100
As you continue to do calculations, are
you

121
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,910
accumulating any round off error in your
compu

122
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,150
[INAUDIBLE].

123
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,760
In your sums things like that, so what we
would like

124
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,428
to be able to do is actually compute
derivatives of the

125
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:46,620
Black-Scholes pricing formula and get the
correct answer theoretically before we

126
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,850
actually have to start plugging in numbers
to the to the formula.

127
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,960
And so, the delta of a European call
option is just the derivative of the

128
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,160
price, so the derivative of the pricing
formula, so in this case c of s with

129
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,980
respect to the asset price s.
And it's denoted by

130
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,890
this Equilateral triangle is capital Greek
letter delta.

131
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,750
And so this is the derivative that I'm
going to try and compute.

132
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,490
So, it's already kind of complicated and
it's much, much

133
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,340
more complicated if I don't plug numbers
into it, because

134
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,010
as soon as I plug the numbers into it, I

135
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,046
can do some math and a lot of them combine
together.

136
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:39,780
but it's still complicated enough that I'm
going to try

137
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,060
and compute the derivative of this term by
term.

138
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,530
So first I'll look at this term and then
we'll

139
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,190
look at this term and we'll try and
simplify our answers

140
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,890
as much as we can.

141
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:56,840
So for the derivative of the first term I
have S times a function of S.

142
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,530
So I'm going to need to use the product
rule.

143
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,270
So that's just going to tell me that the
derivative of this

144
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,020
function here is going to be the
derivative of s times this.

145
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,650
Plus the derivative of this times s.

146
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,780
So here, I have the derivative of s is
just, oops.

147
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,860
Derivative of s is just 1.

148
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,940
So I just have the second piece here.

149
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,910
Then plus s times the derivative of, this
guy.

150
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,090
And I'm just going to replace that by its
definition.

151
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,080
So that's the, the definition of capital
phi of d one of

152
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,010
s is the integral from minus infinity up
to d one of s.

153
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,700
Of little phi of x.

154
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,290
And so we have a formula now for
evaluating this derivative.

155
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,740
So, if I'm taking the derivative of an
indefinite

156
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,309
integral, I know that it's just going to
be.

157
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,610
The integrand evaluated at the upper limit
times the derivative of

158
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,890
the upper limit, with respect to the
variable that I'm, I'm computing.

159
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,330
So I need to use the chain rule here.

160
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,710
And so I'm going to end up with s, that's
this

161
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,040
s here, times lower case phi of d 1 of s.

162
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,360
So that's this phi evaluated at the upper
end point of the integral

163
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,380
and then by the chain rule this is phi of
d of s.

164
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,220
So I need to also multiply that by the
derivative of d1 of s.

165
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,649
So now remember that d1 of s is equal to
10 times the log of s.

166
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,530
Plus 0.015, so the derivative with respect
to s of d1 of s

167
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:52,150
is just going to be 10 divided by s, so 10
times this here that's just a

168
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,550
constant so the derivative of the constant
is zero, the derivative of the log of

169
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,680
s with respect to s is just 1 over s so I
end up with

170
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,549
10 divided by s.

171
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,754
So that tells me that the derivative of
the first term now, this capital phi

172
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:15,370
of d1 of s plus s times lower-case phi of
d1 of s,

173
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,112
times 10 over s, and luckily one of the
nice things about Black-Scholes is

174
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:25,600
usually when you're doing it right stuff
kind of beneficially cancels out for you.

175
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,250
So here, the s and 1 over s are going to
cancel each other out.

176
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,420
So for the first term, the derivative is
capital phi of d

177
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,620
1 of S, plus 10 times little phi of d 1 of
S.

178
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:41,730
Okay.

179
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,710
So now let's look at the derivative of the
second term.

180
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,460
So here it's a little bit easier, so e to
the minus 0.01.

181
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,630
Looks complicated but that's just a
constant.

182
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,050
[COUGH]

183
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,080
So I'm going to take that outside of

184
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,170
my derivative, so the derivative was
linear remember.

185
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:07,610
And I'm left with the derivative of
capital phi of d2 of s.

186
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,910
And I'm just going to, so in the square
brackets is just the definition of that.

187
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:16,580
So that's the integral from minus infinity
to d2 of s, of little phi of x dx.

188
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:28,310
And so I'm going to use my pricing rule
sorry my im.

189
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,650
Improper integral rule

190
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,170
again.

191
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,470
So that's just going to be phi evaluated
at

192
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,290
the upper endpoint, and then by the chain
rule,

193
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,300
I need to divide that, or, sorry, I need

194
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,389
to multiply that by the derivative of d2
of S.

195
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,930
And so remember, d2 of s was just equal to
d1 of s minus 0.1.

196
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,430
So

197
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,490
this is just a constant, so the derivative
of d2 with respect

198
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,050
to s has to be the equal to the derivative
of d1

199
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,030
with respect to s, and we already computed
that, and that was

200
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,690
10 over s, so we can recycle that result a
little bit.

201
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,760
So that's this parked over here I can
replace with 10 over S and

202
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,920
that gives me e to the minus 0.01 times
phi of

203
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,950
d 2 of S times 10 over S.
And

204
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,613
so if I put all of that together.
The derivative of the first term

205
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:37,506
was capital phi of d 1 plus

206
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:41,128
10 times lower case phi of d 1 of s.

207
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,110
And the derivative of the second term so I
was

208
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,220
subtracting the second term so it's
going to be subtracted here.

209
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,325
I have10 over s.

210
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:55,070
E to the minus 0.01 times phi of d 2 of S.

211
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,180
So sorry, I should, this d 1 is a function
of

212
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,740
S, so it should have an S in the
parentheses, as well.

213
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,710
I forgot to put that there.

214
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:07,050
[COUGH]

215
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,240
But unfortunately, we're not finished yet.

216
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:17,980
So remember that little phi of x is equal
to 1 over the square root of 2 pi times

217
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:24,940
e to the minus x squared over 2.
So

218
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,970
what I'd like to do to simplify this.
Instead of having a d1 and a d2 in here.

219
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,410
I want to see if I can rewrite, just
remember d,

220
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,120
d1 and d2 weren't that different, d2 was
just d1 minus 0.1.

221
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,100
So maybe

222
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,620
I can make this simpler by writing writing
this term

223
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,079
in terms of d1 of S rather than d2 of S.

224
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,883
So I'm just going to start plugging things
into this definition of lower case phi.

225
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,592
And so first of all, I'm just going to
evaluate phi

226
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:03,370
at d 2 so I have d 2 of s squared.

227
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,300
Where they used to just be the argument
here.

228
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,010
But I want to have a d 1 there instead.

229
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,950
So I'm going to replace my d 2 with d 1 of
S, minus 0.1.

230
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:21,730
So I have e to the minus phi 1 of S minus
0.1, that quantity squared.

231
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,270
And now I'm going to try and to, to make a
little bit of sense of this.

232
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,500
It would be nice if I had this just in
terms of e to the

233
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,520
d1 of S squared because that, that would
allow me to write it in terms

234
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,569
of phi of d1 of S which would make it
match what's on in this second term here.

235
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,630
And so now what I want to do is sort of my
completing the squares trick backwards,

236
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,310
so let's just start by doing the math.
So the first thing I'm going to do is

237
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:01,010
expand the, the squared term here.
So I had.

238
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:07,330
D1 of S minus 0.1 squared.
So that ends up being d1 squared of S

239
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:14,144
minus 2 times 0.1 times d1 of S, so I have
0.2 d1 of S.

240
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:14,646
Then,

241
00:17:14,646 --> 00:17:21,191
plus negative 0.1 squared, so that becomes
positive 0.01.

242
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:27,630
Let's see.

243
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,780
Did anything change?
No.

244
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,340
I think I made a cutting and pasting error
in this one, so it's hope, hopefully, that

245
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:44,894
doesn't last too long.
Okay, so essentially what was

246
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:51,836
supposed to happen in this line,

247
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:58,520
and I guess I somehow missed it.

248
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,635
Here I have 0.01 divided by 2, so that's

249
00:18:03,635 --> 00:18:08,590
going to be 0.005 and remember when

250
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:14,190
I'm adding things together in an exponent,
I can also think of that as a product

251
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,980
of e to each one of those terms.
So what I meant to

252
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,630
do in this line here, I wanted to have e
to

253
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,970
the minus d1 squared over 2.
That's what's going to end up here.

254
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm going to have minus times minus, so.

255
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,180
E to the minus, or e to the positive 0.2 d
one but

256
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,790
I'm dividing that by two so I get e to the
0.1 d one.

257
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,290
And

258
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:51,240
then, 0.01 divided by two was 0.05.
And that was just going to end up also

259
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,398
over here and remember there's the minus
sign multiplying it here so I have minus.

260
00:18:55,398 --> 00:19:01,170
0.01 minus 0.005.
And that's what gives me this term here.

261
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,250
So hopefully, that would have been a
little bit

262
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,790
more clear if I had, not messed up this
line.

263
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,290
But,

264
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,150
okay.
And now I've, I've written this bit.

265
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,050
The one over 2 pi here.

266
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:22,020
E to the minus d 1 of s squared over 2,

267
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,930
well that's exactly what phi of d 1 of s
would be.

268
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,210
So hopefully that's starting to look a
little bit simpler now.

269
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:35,509
And now remember I had d 1 was just 10
times.

270
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,520
The log of, 10 times the log of S,
hopefully that'll show

271
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,988
up here.
10 times the log of S plus

272
00:19:46,988 --> 00:19:52,110
0.15.
And so

273
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:57,820
here I have e to the log of S.
That's just going to be S.

274
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,080
Because this is a sum I could also think
of this as e to the positive 0.015

275
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,180
so that's going to cancel out my e to the
negative 0.015 or you could also think

276
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:14,210
of it as just I'm adding those two numbers
together getting e to the 0 and that's 1.

277
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,160
So this bit here is going to cancel out
this bit here.

278
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,690
This e to the log of s, that's going to be

279
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,760
just s, so that's going to cancel out my s
down here,

280
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,660
so what I am left with is this second term
the, the

281
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,279
magnitude of it being equal to 10 times
phi of d1 of s.

282
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,300
[INAUDIBLE]

283
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:41,300
.

284
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,370
So now, let's go back and look at my, my
formula for the delta of c.

285
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:52,400
And so the delta of c was originally phi
of d1,

286
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,180
plus 10 times lower-case phi of d1.
And then minus.

287
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,446
And we've just showed that this thing, 10
over s.

288
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:04,010
Times e to the minus 0.01 times phi of d2
of s.

289
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,786
That was the same thing as

290
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:16,710
10 times phi of d1 of s.
So what

291
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,340
I end up with is capital phi of d1 plus 10
lower-case phi minus 10 lower-case phi.

292
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,140
And in the end we find that the delta for

293
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,560
this call option, is actually just capital
phi of D 1.
