1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,820
So next section is improper integrals.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,320
An improper integral is just above the,
let's

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,150
see, I guess I should go to my slide.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,190
and an improper integral comes in two
types.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,986
So, you might be interested in integrating
a function over an unbounded interval

6
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:25,480
so that would be an interval where at
least one of the end points is infinite.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,494
Or the function

8
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:30,706
could be unbounded, so I might be
integrating something like 1

9
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:33,870
over x and one of the end points would be
zero.

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,961
So, the limit as my function approaches
zero is going to be infinite.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,093
And so these are going to be the
conditions

12
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:43,576
where we can make sense of integrals like
that.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,720
So we'll start by considering the first
type, so I want to integrate a function f

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:59,600
of x over either the inter, interval minus
infinity b or the interval a to infinity.

15
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,408
And if I want to integrate a function over
the entire

16
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:07,375
real line so minus infinity to infinity I
just think

17
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,514
of it as I pick some point in the middle

18
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:12,000
and go up to there and then finish the
rest.

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,100
The improper integral of f of x over a

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,058
infinity Exists if and only if the limit,
so

21
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:26,846
basically all I'm going to do, I want to

22
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:30,150
have an infinite, infinity up in the top
here.

23
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,345
But if I actually plugged in an infinity,

24
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,592
most of the time something's going to go
wrong.

25
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,720
So I want to consider this as a limit.

26
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,306
I'll evaluate this integral using a and t,
and then take

27
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:49,820
the limit of the resulting function as t
goes to infinity.

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,642
If that limit exists and it's finite, then
we say

29
00:01:53,642 --> 00:01:58,010
that the improper integral of f of x over
(a, infinity)

30
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,550
exists.

31
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,430
So now it's getting a bit trickier, so our

32
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,900
definition of existing means the limit
exists and it's finite.

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,856
And so in particular, that means that if
this

34
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:15,448
integral, you know, as I take the limit as

35
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:19,000
t goes to infinity, if I get infinity,
Then

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,020
f of x is not integrable over this this
interval.

37
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,202
And then we do exactly the same thing
except now I have a t on the

38
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:34,990
bottom so when I want the, the lower limit
to be able to go to minus infinity.

39
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,943
I'm just going to put t in the bottom and

40
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:40,050
take the limit as t goes to minus
infinity.

41
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,770
And the condition has to be the same.

42
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,130
For this to be well-defined, I need this
limit to

43
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,990
exist, and I need it to be a finite value.

44
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,305
And so when those limits exist and they're
finite, then I'm going

45
00:02:57,305 --> 00:03:01,980
to define the improper integral of f of x
dx over a infinity.

46
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,634
To be the value of this limit, so the, the
limit s t

47
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:09,620
goes to infinity integral from a to t of f
of x d x.

48
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,568
And then the, sort of the complementary
piece for

49
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:17,610
the lower limit, so I'm going to define
the improper

50
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,960
integral from minus infinity to b of f of
x d x.

51
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,509
To be the value of this limit, as t goes
to minus

52
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:28,950
infinite, the integral of t to b of f of x
d x.

53
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:35,682
So you can also add and subtract improper

54
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:41,840
integrals, so all I'm doing here.

55
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:47,705
Is I'm considering b greater than a so
this is a normal

56
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:51,905
way of setting up an integral if I think
of if I think

57
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:55,181
of an interval I have a lower end point of
a and an

58
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:58,710
upper end point of b so b has to be
greater than a.

59
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,800
And so if I intergrate.
f of x, from a to infinity.

60
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,550
The integral of f of x from b to infinity
has to sort of fit inside of that.

61
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,260
So what I've done, is I've said is a to
infity.

62
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,990
and then b to infinity.

63
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,674
And if I do this subtraction, all I
want to think about

64
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:24,740
is, I'm taking a to infinity, infinnity is
way over there.

65
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,373
And b to infinity and I'm just sort of
chopping of

66
00:04:29,373 --> 00:04:33,780
the tail at b, and so probably just as you
would

67
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,108
expect what's left is just going to be the
integral of f of x from a to

68
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:46,530
b, and then I can do exactly the same
thing with the other tail.

69
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,611
So if I have the integral from minus
infinity up

70
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:52,218
to b, so remember b is bigger than a, so

71
00:04:52,218 --> 00:04:55,141
this integral, minus infinity up to a of f
of

72
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:58,933
x, that's if you imagine what the area
looks like,

73
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:03,360
that's just going to fit in the first, the
first area.

74
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,110
And so what I did.

75
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,002
When I do this subtraction, essentially
all I'm

76
00:05:08,002 --> 00:05:10,048
doing is just chopping off the tail at

77
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:13,570
a, and again I'm left with the integral
from a to b of f of x dx.

78
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,370
Okay.

79
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,494
And now I want to be able to also

80
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:28,730
make sensitive integral over the entire
real line.

81
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,426
So like I mentioned before, the integral
from minus infinity to infinity of

82
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:40,140
f of x, this is going to exist if and only
if there's a point a such that both.

83
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,572
The integral from minus infinity up to a,
and the integral from

84
00:05:45,572 --> 00:05:48,976
a to infinity of f of x exists so in
particular both those

85
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:50,240
need to be finite.

86
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,840
And then if that integral exists We're
just going to define its value.

87
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,925
So I, I'm just splitting up the real line
out of point

88
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:10,720
a so I have numbers bigger than a and
numbers smaller than a.

89
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,098
The value of this integral is just
going to be the sum

90
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:17,040
of these two integrals that we know how to
compute already.

91
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,713
And so I just wrote down the, the
definitions down below, and the reason

92
00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:25,968
we need to be able to split this thing in
the

93
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:30,990
middle, you know, why, why not just define
our limit like this

94
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,152
so i take the limit as t goes to infinity
of

95
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:37,382
the integral from minus t to t of f of x
dx.

96
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:42,548
So that, that seems like it should work
its going to get the whole real line but

97
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:47,878
the problem we are running into, is I
could do something like this, so what,

98
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:51,076
what I'm doing here just imagining a line
with

99
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:54,274
a slop of 45 degrees so for positive
values of

100
00:06:54,274 --> 00:06:57,636
x that's going to be above the x axis, for
negative

101
00:06:57,636 --> 00:07:00,740
values of x it's going to be below the x
axis.

102
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:09,070
So if I integrate that from t to t, I'm
always going to get zero.

103
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,362
But if I split it up anywhere in the
middle, I

104
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:18,380
would end up getting a minus infinity and
a plus infinity.

105
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,916
And kind of like we saw in the first
lecture when we're looking

106
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:25,050
at this series of 1 minus 1 plus 1 minus 1
you know.

107
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,027
If I have something that I can express as
infinity

108
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:34,000
minus infinity, I can't really make any
sense out of that.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,964
Another good way to imagine what's
happening

110
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:41,068
with this is, I could also get an intergal
from minus infinity to

111
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:45,790
infinity by putting a 2t up here but then
that would mean that.

112
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,750
All of these integrals here, instead of
integrating

113
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,790
to zero, they would integrate to some,
let's see.

114
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,300
Well this one would depend on t, but

115
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,097
if you're clever about the choice, you can
make

116
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:07,479
these all integrate to some non-zero
value, so as you

117
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,019
take the limit, then you can get any
answer you want to.

118
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:18,297
So if I, if I defined it this way, I would
have the limit from minus t to

119
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:23,666
t being 0, but then I'm not going to have
the property, so I wanted to be

120
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:28,936
able to do addition and subtraction with
my indefinite integrals.

121
00:08:28,936 --> 00:08:31,776
And so now If I try to do that, if, if I
want to add

122
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:36,035
two together, I need to be able to break
it up somewhere in the middle.

123
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:38,939
And that's gona give me, so if I take a
being zero for

124
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:43,910
instance, I'm going to get minus infinity
plus infinity and that's not defined.

125
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,200
On the other hand, if you know for some
reason, so for instance

126
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,840
if you know that f of x belongs to a
family of function.

127
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,720
So I'm thinking of probability density
functions, where this integral does exist.

128
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,560
Then you're free to evaluate it however
you like.

129
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,940
So if you know that this integral exist
basically what that's

130
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,930
telling you is if you evaluated correctly
and get an answer.

131
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,730
That's going to be the correct answer.

132
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,240
So you can evaluate it however you like,
you'll get the same answer.

133
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,380
So you can evaluate it however you like.

134
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,996
So this formula if it was useful, you

135
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:27,290
could use it to evaluate an improper
integral.

136
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:38,440
Okay, so now This is probably going to be
a little bit strange for some of you.

137
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,720
But, I want to, for my example, show that
for an

138
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,148
integer value of alpha, that's greater
than or equal to zero,

139
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:50,248
this integral, so the integral from zero
to infinity, of x

140
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:53,940
to the alpha, times e to the minus x
squared exists.

141
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,622
And so what's going to happen with, with
this particular

142
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:02,814
argument if I'm pretty sure the way you
would

143
00:10:02,814 --> 00:10:06,158
actually evaluate this, if you wanted to
get if

144
00:10:06,158 --> 00:10:08,890
you wanted to get a number for an answer.

145
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,709
You need to use integration by parts.

146
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,687
And when you use integration by parts,
you're going to

147
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:19,290
end up with an integral where alpha is 1
smaller.

148
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,172
And so if alpha

149
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:24,630
was, say, 10, you would need to use
integration by parts ten times.

150
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:31,400
but I want to get a result that's valid
for any alpha that's greater than zero.

151
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,820
And so this is kind of a strange
situation.

152
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,870
Well remember, I said this integral exists
if the limit is finite.

153
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,014
So I can show that the limit is finite,

154
00:10:41,014 --> 00:10:44,670
without actually finding out what that
limit is specifically.

155
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,290
But if I can say whatever limit it

156
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,090
is, it's less than a finite number, then I
can say that this integral exists.

157
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,810
This indefinite integral exists.

158
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:03,720
So, what I want to show, is that if I
integrate this function from zero to t.

159
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,670
And then I take the limit as t goes to
infinity.

160
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,830
I have to get a finite number.

161
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,314
And so another sort of shorthand for
finite

162
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:15,170
is you just write strictly less than
infinity.

163
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,502
So that means some real number.

164
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:18,890
some finite real number.

165
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,940
So, we can recall form the, from the first
lecture when I was talking about limits.

166
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:36,510
If p of x is a poloynomial and e to the x
is the exponential function.

167
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:42,110
Then if I take the limit of this as x goes
to infinity I get 0.

168
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,450
So in particular, I have this minus x
squared here.

169
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,062
So if I have

170
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:51,920
e to a negative power I can also write
that as 1 over e to that power.

171
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,264
So I can rewrite the integrand here as x

172
00:11:56,264 --> 00:12:01,660
to the alpha Divided by e to the x
squared.

173
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,764
And so, by using those rules of limits,
you can also show that this is

174
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:12,140
going to the limit of this as x goes to
infinity is also going to be 0.

175
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,340
And so, you might

176
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:18,430
wonder why this plus 2 is up there,
because there's no plus 2 in the intregran

177
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,566
And the answer is you know I just put it
there because I want it

178
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:30,330
there.
So it, it'll pop out later on.

179
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,186
And so often when you're trying to work
these things out, so I know

180
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:37,030
how to solve this problem already, so I
can put the plus 2 there.

181
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,515
Otherwise I wouldn't have put the plus

182
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:40,540
2 there, I would have done more work.

183
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,700
I would have realized, hey, it would be
really

184
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,980
handy if there's another x squared in this
equation.

185
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,260
So then I would have gone backwards to
this line.

186
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,210
I would have added 2 to this exponent.

187
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,110
But the point is, it's not it's not meant
to be equal to this.

188
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,960
It's basically, what's going to end up
happening is that

189
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,162
I can now Write this as something times x
squared and

190
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:09,310
have my limit here, or, my integrand here.
And so

191
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,386
this, the, if, if I consider a sequence as
the x goes to

192
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:19,611
infinity, this is going to be equal to 0.
And so because

193
00:13:19,611 --> 00:13:24,525
I know that limits equal to 0, I can now
use the

194
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:29,817
definition to say that there is a value M
so capital

195
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:36,117
M such that, so this is my, my integrand
again this value is

196
00:13:36,117 --> 00:13:42,669
less than 1 whenever x is greater than M,
so this is basically

197
00:13:42,669 --> 00:13:48,465
this epsilon delta argument except you
know, for

198
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:54,811
the, for the, for the sequence that is
going to infinity.

199
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:57,241
So the epsilon is 1 and then that

200
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:01,021
means because I know the limit exists,
there must

201
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:03,991
be some value such that when I'm beyond

202
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:07,321
that value I'm within epsilon of what I
want

203
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:12,811
it to be and so I'm going to choose 1, I
can choose any number I want to by the

204
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:18,945
definition of the limit but I'm going to
choose 1 because its easy to work with.

205
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,010
So generally when

206
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,631
you are free to choose a number, if you
choose anything other

207
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:27,397
than zero or one, you better have a really
good reason for it.

208
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:30,477
So now it should be clear why I wanted
this x

209
00:14:30,477 --> 00:14:34,173
squared here, so if this quantity has to
be less 1

210
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,693
one then I can just divide both sides by x
squared

211
00:14:37,693 --> 00:14:42,233
and so I'm considering the limit as x goes
to infinity.

212
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:45,149
you know, at some point this M is going to
be

213
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:47,071
a number bigger than zero.

214
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:51,230
And x, you know, I'm looking at values of
x greater than that M.

215
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,600
So x is not going to be 0.

216
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,920
So I can divide by x as many times as I
want to.

217
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,680
So I'm going to divide by x twice.
So my alpha over 2 becomes an alpha.

218
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,780
And my 1 becomes a 1 over x squared.

219
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,324
And so the important thing that I've done
here is I've taken the integrand and I've

220
00:15:10,324 --> 00:15:15,792
bounded it by one over x squared.
So that means for every value of x greater

221
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:21,900
than M, this thing is going to be less
than one over x squared.

222
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,250
And what that's going to let me do.

223
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:30,070
Is now if I consider values of t that are
greater than M, I'm

224
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:35,374
going to split my integral so my integral
zero to t into a piece

225
00:15:35,374 --> 00:15:36,518
from zero to M

226
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,038
[COUGH]

227
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:39,920
and another piece from M up to t.

228
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,104
And now what can I say about the, the
first term here?

229
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,280
Though it's not pretty, but 0 is a
constant and M is a

230
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,589
constant, so whatever, you know whatever
number this is it's going to be constant.

231
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,642
And so, t is the only thing that's
changing now,

232
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:08,280
this is the, what I'm taking to be the
limit.

233
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,060
So I can just rewrite this as a constant.

234
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,590
It's no longer really important.
If it's constant, it's finite.

235
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,174
And I'll I'm trying to do, is show that
this

236
00:16:18,174 --> 00:16:20,150
thing is not going to be infinite.

237
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:32,430
And also I have said that this integrand
can be bounded by 1 over x squared.

238
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,694
So if I were to replace this with 1

239
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:39,400
over x squared, like I've done in the
second line.

240
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,670
It means it's everywhere for t bigger then
M, x squared is bigger than that.

241
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,780
So c, this thing, plus the integral from m
to t.

242
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,286
You remember one of the properties of the
integral was if I

243
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:55,146
had to functions and one of those
functions was always bigger than

244
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:58,992
the other function, If I integrate both of
those functions over the

245
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:01,138
same integral, then whichever function is

246
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:03,620
always bigger, it's integral is also
bigger.

247
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,560
So that allows me to bound this integral
by some constant,

248
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,430
and a func, and the integral of one over x
squared.

249
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,833
And now one over x squares,

250
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,730
that's something that is actually easy to
integrate.

251
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,956
So that just becomes minus 1 over x so 1
over x

252
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:26,564
squared, I can think of that as x to the
minus 2 power

253
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:30,746
and I can use my anti-power rule and that
just means its going

254
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:34,995
to come from, its the derivative of minus
x to the minus 1.

255
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:43,070
So I get minus x to the minus 1 here
evaluated at from M to t.

256
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,980
So again

257
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,280
I can rewrite that now as a constant minus
this thing here.

258
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,010
So this is just to summarize what I've
done on the other slide.

259
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:03,652
I now have bounded this integral from zero
to t of this very unhappy looking

260
00:18:03,652 --> 00:18:10,050
integrand, by this expression over here
that's a much simpler expression of t.

261
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,400
And so I have c plus 1 over M so these are
just constant.

262
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,050
And now remember what I was trying to do
is show that the limit

263
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,550
of this guy over here as t goes to
infinity is approaching a finite value.

264
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:37,838
And so 1 over t, for t is positive.
So, this can never be, this can

265
00:18:37,838 --> 00:18:45,510
never be bigger than c plus 1 over M.
So, I can make an upper bound of c.

266
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:48,800
So, that's the integral of my integrand
from 0 to M.

267
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,930
That's a constant value, so, it's going to
be finite.

268
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,912
And then M is a really big number, and I
have 1 over

269
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:59,520
M, so I have to add just a little bit more
to my constant.

270
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,570
And that gets me an upper bound, for no
matter what value of t

271
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,010
I choose, this is it's going to be smaller
c plus 1 over M.

272
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,080
So that means I can say that the limit as
t goes to infinity Of the

273
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,040
integral from 0 to t of x to the alpha, e
to the minus x squared.

274
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,390
That's going to be less than c plus 1 over
M.

275
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,840
And that's going to be a finite number.

276
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,270
So I write less than infinity.

277
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,146
And so without actually evaluating this
integral, and finding out

278
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:34,370
the, the number, I was able to show that,
let's see.

279
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,230
That this indefinite integral, from 0 to
infinity, of x

280
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,430
to the alpha, e to the minus x squared,
dx.

281
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,300
This exists.
