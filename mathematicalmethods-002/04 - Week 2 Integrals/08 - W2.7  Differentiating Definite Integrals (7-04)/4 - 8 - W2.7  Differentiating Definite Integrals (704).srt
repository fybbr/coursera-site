1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,630
So now moving on.
So

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,880
the first six lessons I was just trying to

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,350
talk about what an integral is, the
problem I'm trying

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,240
to answer and then some techniques that
we're going to

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,570
use in 461 and in later courses for
evaluating integrals.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,570
Now I need some, some special results, eh,
in

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,750
particular I'm driving at is, is
differentiating improper integrals.

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,400
Because this is going to be something you
need to be able to do

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,890
when you want to work with the black

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:31,990
[UNKNOWN],

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,810
spacing formula.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,950
Eh, and so I'm going to first

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:39,310
get started by just differentiating
definite integrals.

14
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:42,120
Then I'll introduce what an improper
integral is.

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,080
And then we will learn how to take their
derivatives.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,300
So this is actually not too difficult of a
topic.

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,400
So hopefully this set will go by quickly.

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,780
So first start out by pointing out that a
definite integral, so if I

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,920
integrate a function f of x over an
interval ab, that's a real number.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,290
So it's constant, it's not changing.

21
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,310
So if I try and take the derivitive of

22
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,720
this function, it's constant so it's
derivative is zero.

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,530
So the only way this is going to get
exciting is

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,360
if the limits so that the A and the B are

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,310
now functions of a, of another variable.
So I, I chose T.

26
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,370
Then when I evaluate this definite
integral

27
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,820
it still going to be a function of

28
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,440
T and so I might want to consider taking
its derivative with respect to T.

29
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:42,460
And then more generally the integrand
could also have T in it.

30
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,150
But since we haven't talked about
functions of more than

31
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,860
one variable yet, I'm going to leave that
for lesson three.

32
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,280
And so the question we want to consider is

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,920
how can I calculate the derivative, with
respect to T,

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,950
of the integral of, of function f of x

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,310
where the limits depend our functions of
the value t.

36
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,250
So it's actually pretty straightforward.

37
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,100
If I wanted to just evaluate this
integral.

38
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,220
What I would do is find an antiderivative
of my function.

39
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,859
And then by the fundamental theorem of
calculus.

40
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,780
I could evaluate this integral.

41
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,200
It's just going to be the anti-derivative
evaluated at the top

42
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,900
end point, and the anti-derivative
evaluated at the bottom end point.

43
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:35,900
[BLANK_AUDIO]

44
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,400
And

45
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,360
now, if I take the derivative of this
well,

46
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,360
all I have here is a function of a
function.

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,780
So I can take the derivative of that,
using the chain rule.

48
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,240
And so what I'm going to get is G prime of
T, so G

49
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,520
is a function of T, so I'm taking it's
derivative with respect to T.

50
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,070
That's just going to be equal to the
derivative

51
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,800
of the outside function, evaluated at the
inside function.

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,860
And then by the chain rule, I have to

53
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,350
also multiply that by the derivative of
the inside function.

54
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,740
And it looks a little bit complicated,

55
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,030
but all I'm doing is just I have to put
once

56
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,690
for the upper end point, and once for the
lower end point.

57
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,120
And then by the way we've defined this
capital F, I know its derivative is

58
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,450
lowercase f, so the formula for
differentiating a definite integral is

59
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,955
just going to be f(b(t)) times b'(t) minus
f(a(t)) times a'(t).

60
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,790
And so just to state it with all of its
actual conditions.

61
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,050
So this is the, this is the definition
that came out of the course textbook.

62
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,450
So F has to be a continuous function.

63
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,699
And a of t and b of t have to be
differentiable functions.

64
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,070
Then, the derivative with respect to T, of
the integral from A of

65
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,320
T to B of T of F of X DX is just F of

66
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,980
B of T times B prime of T minus F of A of
T times A prime of T.

67
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,820
A so just a, a quick example of this.

68
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,320
I think this is my simplified version of
exercise 11 from, from chapter one.

69
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,750
So, let's let g of x be defined as 1 over
the square root of

70
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:36,330
2 pi times the integral from 0 to b of x
of e to the minus t squared over 2.

71
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,830
And then, b of x is just going to be
defined by this

72
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,510
function here.

73
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,620
Which can be simplified the way I've done
it in the light grey on the right.

74
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,080
And so this is actually a calculation
you'll, you'll come across

75
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,440
These are, these are sort of pieces of the

76
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,540
black sholes pricing formula, so this is
the interest rate.

77
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,160
This is the, this is the volatility but
again since

78
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,100
I haven't talked about functions of
multiple variables yet I

79
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,700
just wanted to plug in specific numbers so
it doesn't

80
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,520
get too confusing about what I'm actually
trying to do.

81
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,680
And so the, the goal then is to compute g
prime of x,

82
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,180
and so is this the, the formula from the
previous slide.

83
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,620
But now since my lower limit is zero, so
it's constant with respect to x, if I

84
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,540
take its derivative, this, this a prime of
t is just going to be equal to 0.

85
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,000
So derivative of a constant.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,840
So this formula will simplify a bit,
because of a being equal to 0.

87
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,710
So all I need to do is just evaluate my
function.

88
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,240
And then multiply by the

89
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,390
derivative of the inside.

90
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,680
So the first step I will do is just
evaluate my function g of x,

91
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,250
so this bit here.
I'm just going to evaluate that at b.

92
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,092
And so I get, I had 5 times log of x plus
0.06.

93
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:10,740
So when I square that, I'm going to end up
with

94
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,010
25 times the log of x plus 0.06, that
quantity squared.

95
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,010
[BLANK_AUDIO]

96
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:15,510
And

97
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:25,070
then I still need to multiply it by the
derivative, then of b of x.

98
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,930
So, b of x was equal to 5 times the log of
x plus 0.06.

99
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,530
And so that's pretty easy to see the
derivative of, that's 5 times log of x.

100
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:43,290
That's derivative is 5 divided by x and 5
times 0.06, that's just going to be

101
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,940
a constant, so we don't even need to
bother

102
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,880
doing the math, that's going to have a
derivative of 0.

103
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,480
So b'(x) is just going to be 5 divided by
x,

104
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,580
and so I just need to put all of the
pieces

105
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,463
together, which just means substituting in
5 over x for b'(x),

106
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,009
And that gives me the derivative of my
function g(x).
