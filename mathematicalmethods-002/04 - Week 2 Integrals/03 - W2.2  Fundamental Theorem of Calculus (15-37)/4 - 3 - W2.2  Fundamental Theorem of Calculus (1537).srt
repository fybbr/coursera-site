1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:05,490
So there're very, very few functions where
you're going to be able to just look

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,160
at it and see what the area is and use
that to evaluate the integral.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,220
So clearly, we need something a bit better
than that.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,584
So the fundamental theorem of calculus,
really gives us

5
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:18,600
the rule that's going to allow us to
evaluate that,

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,032
[INAUDIBLE]

7
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:19,840
most integrals.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,820
So I'll start off by defining, something
called an anti-derivative.

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,384
So if f as a function is an integrable
function, then the

10
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:39,040
anti-derivative of f, so I use f from my
original function.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,411
I'm in use the capital F, to mean the
anti-derivative

12
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:48,280
Of my function, is a function that
satisfies this property.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,310
So capital f is the anti derivative of f
of x, if and only if, f prime.

14
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,640
So capital f prime of x is equal to f of
x.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,350
So what I want to find is a function
capital f that has the property

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,110
That when I take its derivative, it gives
me the function I started out with.

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,428
And this, so when I, when I, write the
integral

18
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:13,328
symbol without limits on it, so notice it
doesn't have and

19
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:14,410
a, and a, b here.

20
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,343
I'm not talking about evaluating the
integral and trying to come up

21
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:22,720
with a number I'm just putting that symbol
in front of a function.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,270
That's My symbol for take the
antiderivative.

23
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,450
Sometimes also called an indefinite
integral.

24
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,340
And one of the problems we're going to

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,600
run into is that antiderivative, is not
unique.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,700
So I can

27
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,802
Add any constant, any arbitrary constant I
want to, to my

28
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:50,770
anti derivative and when I take the
derivative of that function.

29
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,207
The derivative of the constant is going to
be zero, and if f of

30
00:01:55,207 --> 00:02:00,850
x capital f of x here is the anti
derivative of my little f function.

31
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,087
Than the derivative of this quantity, is
also

32
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:07,750
going to be a valid antiderivative for my
function.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,636
So this means in particular if I ever say
what is the indefinite integral.

34
00:02:13,636 --> 00:02:21,139
Or what is the anti derivative of, to be
correct you have to add a constant

35
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:28,113
after you've figured what the kind of the
core of the function is.

36
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:31,428
And the trick now of the fundamental
theorem of

37
00:02:31,428 --> 00:02:35,338
calculus, is when a closed form of the
antiderivative

38
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:41,090
exists then we can use the following
theorem to evaluate a definite integral.

39
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,405
So I'm going to put some conditions on my
function f, f of x

40
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:51,400
has to be continuous on the interval where
I'd like to integrate it.

41
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:00,770
Then the integral of little f of x dx over
the integral of ab is

42
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,810
just equal To the anti=derivative of
little f(x), evaluated

43
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,130
at b minus the anti-derivative of little f
evaluated at a.

44
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,660
And the trick here is this is true for
every single anti-derivative?

45
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,117
So, if I look up, here you might

46
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,969
think what's going to happen to the c.

47
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,948
But essentially, if I added a c on here,
I'm going to get c times b minus

48
00:03:28,948 --> 00:03:30,620
a, and it has to be the same

49
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,780
anti-derivative for both the upper and
lower endpoint.

50
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,864
So I end up with c times b minus a, minus
c times b minus a, and so it doesn't

51
00:03:39,864 --> 00:03:45,240
matter what constant I choose, that That
amount is always going to

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,024
cancel itself out, so you might as well
choose the C

53
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:53,560
that is easiest, and for me the easiest
one is usually zero.

54
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,920
And so this is going to be our rule for
evaluating integrals, the

55
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,765
bulk of the work is going to be finding
the antiderivative, capital F

56
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:07,325
>> And then, I just need to evaluate it
at the upper

57
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:10,628
end point and at the lower end point and
take the difference.

58
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:10,628
>>

59
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:10,644
[INAUDIBLE]

60
00:04:10,644 --> 00:04:16,692
>> The, the constant

61
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:25,130
makes it non-unique.

62
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,090
So you know, I could have, if I found a
function F of f

63
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,230
that has the property that when I take its
derivative,

64
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,838
I get f of x.
Then I could also

65
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:40,734
add I could say F of f plus 1, and when I
take the derivative of that, I get the

66
00:04:40,734 --> 00:04:43,542
derivative of f of x plus the derivative
of 1,

67
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:46,880
which would just be the derivative of f of
x.

68
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,650
>> Which is my little F of X.

69
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,721
So, the little F of, differentiation has a

70
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:57,720
unique answer, but the anti-derivative has
a non-unique answer.

71
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,078
But, you can understand it by adding, just
it's only

72
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:03,280
every going to be off by a constant.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,240
So, for example, suppose capital F of x is
equal to one-half of x squared.

74
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,710
So here I'm going to cheat a little bit.

75
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,280
I still haven't talked about how we're
going to find anti-derivatives.

76
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,064
So I'm just going to start out with the
anti-derivative,

77
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:25,460
and then get my little f of x by
differentiating.

78
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,321
Then by the power rule, I just take 2
times 1/2 x

79
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:35,960
to the 2 minus 1, so that's just going to
be x.

80
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,522
So the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
says the area under

81
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:46,200
the curve f of x equals x from 0 to b.

82
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,841
So that's my integral of little f of x
from 0 to

83
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:55,850
b, is going to be capital F of b minus
capital F of 0.

84
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,300
And I know what capital F is, because
that's where I started.

85
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,800
So I get 1/2 b squared minus 1/2 0
squared.

86
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,540
So this second term is obviously just
going to disappear.

87
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:13,878
And so that tells me, that the area under
the curve little

88
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:19,470
f of x equals x is just from zero to b is
1/2 b squared.

89
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,898
And so I think if I draw a picture of

90
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:23,710
this, it's pretty obvious that's just the
area of a triangle.

91
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,040
And so we know the formula for the area of
a triangle.

92
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,009
So area of a triangle

93
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:30,880
should be one half base times height.

94
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:38,820
And we get exactly the same thing by
solving this question with integration.

95
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,610
So that, that's a very good thing to do
when you're.

96
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,150
Trying out you know, new mathematical
methods.

97
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,600
This probably seems like a very easy
operation.

98
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,538
But if it's not giving you the right
answer,

99
00:06:49,538 --> 00:06:51,170
you know, it's you don't want to go a

100
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,210
lot further and find out it's not working,
and

101
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,070
that you could've seen that at the very
first step.

102
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,429
So you want to check it on the, on the
obvious examples.

103
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,030
So evaluating definite integrals basically
boils down to finding anti derivatives.

104
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,258
And unfortunately this isn't as

105
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:14,280
straightforward as differentiation so at
differentiation.

106
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,920
We, we, have a set of rules, and it was
pretty clear

107
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,510
how you could use those rules to compute
the derivative of a function.

108
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,322
Essentially for finding an anti-derivative
we're going to use the

109
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:28,580
same rules but just try, and use them
backwards.

110
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,652
So we're going to be looking for things
that we

111
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:34,330
recognize as the derivatives of functions
that we know.

112
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,921
And then once we've identified that, we
can then go ahead and replace that

113
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:41,630
with the, with the function that would
have that at its, as its derivative.

114
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,450
So the easiest one of these is just
going to be

115
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,410
the, the power rule so I've decided to
call the

116
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,270
indefinite integral of x to the n the
anti-power rule.

117
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,790
I Googled that I don't think anybody else
has used

118
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:57,449
that word yet so this might be unique to
this class.

119
00:07:58,742 --> 00:08:01,544
the technique is definitely not unique.

120
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:03,656
and I think this was probably the first

121
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:07,060
type of antiderivative anybody figured out
how to compute.

122
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,770
So, if I want to find a antiderivative of
x to the

123
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,993
n, while I know that the power must have
been n plus 1.

124
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,730
And then if I was going to take the
derivative of x to the n plus 1,

125
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,170
I know that an n plus 1 would pop out in
the front by the power rule.

126
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,740
So I better divide by 1 over n plus 1 so I
can cancel that out.

127
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,165
And so I end up with this function here.
And if you take the

128
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:38,940
derivative of that, I just have n plus 1
times 1 over n plus 1.

129
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,570
So that gets rid of the coefficient.

130
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,990
And then I'd have x to the n plus 1 minus
1, or x to the n.

131
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,256
And then just to be complete, I add an
arbitrary constant to this

132
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:55,260
because when I take the derivative of
that, that's going to always be 0.

133
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,342
And after that essentially, what we need
to do is just come up with a dictionary

134
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:02,180
of functions that we know.

135
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,588
And what they're derivatives are, and then
we'll

136
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,310
be able to try and use that backwards.

137
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,280
So some common functions are if I have

138
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,640
a, a function that's equal to zero
everywhere,

139
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,840
it's derivative is equal to zero because
it's

140
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,960
a constant and the derivative of that is
zero,

141
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,750
If I have just a constant then I can use
my anti power

142
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,230
rule trick, I can just pretend that's c
times x to the 0.

143
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,529
Define that the antiderivative of a
constant is just c times x.

144
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,760
And then some important functions e to the
x.

145
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,162
Remember this was a special function where
it was equal to its own

146
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:48,879
derivative so here it's also going to do
that backwards it's going to

147
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,667
be a special function where it's, it's own
anti-derivative except in this column

148
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:57,205
we should have a c an arbitrary constant
could be added to that.

149
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:01,110
1/x.

150
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,611
So you might look at this and think,
that's just

151
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:06,830
x to the -1, that probably came from the
power rule.

152
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,882
Except if you try that, you'll realize
that

153
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:12,250
this won't work backwards for that one
particular case.

154
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,022
And it turns out that the antiderivative
of

155
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:18,069
1/x is actually equal to the logarithm of
x.

156
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,990
And then here we had before.

157
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,494
I, I think this was the one that I asked
my phone for.

158
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:30,448
the derivative of sine is cosine.

159
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,748
So the anti-derivative of cosine is sine
and then again for

160
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:37,260
all of these we could always add an
arbitrary constant to that.

161
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,280
The capital f.

162
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,780
Colon.

163
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:49,190
And then also the anti-derivative of
sin(x) then -cos(x).

164
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,910
And so these are things where you can
either look in one of those big fat

165
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,490
calculus textbooks to find tables of
integrals and

166
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,470
they get a lot more complicated than this.

167
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,312
You can use computer algebra software, or
you can just try

168
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:04,930
using something like Wolfram|Alpha to try
to find the answer to these.

169
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,632
And so just some quick examples that, some
simple examples

170
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,467
again, of using some of the properties I
went through

171
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:20,810
in the last set of slides, and then And
then

172
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:24,590
some of these anti-derivative rules that
I've just shown now.

173
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,620
Let's consider evaluating the definite
integral over the interval from two

174
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,020
to five of three x squared plus two x plus
one.

175
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,626
So the first property I'm going to use is
linearity property so I can split

176
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:41,800
this up into three separate integrals and
then I can use the, my anti-power rule.

177
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,940
3 times.

178
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,402
And so because of the way I've written
this

179
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:54,030
down, these are all just derivatives of
powers of x.

180
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,620
So 3x squared is the derivative of x
cubed.

181
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,540
2x the derivative of x.

182
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,580
And dx is the derivative of X.

183
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,970
And then I need to evaluate these each
term.

184
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,390
Evaluated at the upper endpoint and
subtracted at the lower endpoint.

185
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,670
So here my function is x cubed.

186
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,820
So I'm going to evaluate it at the upper
endpoint.

187
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,280
I get 5 cubed.

188
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,430
And then subtract that function evaluated
at the lower endpoint.

189
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,810
I get 2 cubed.

190
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,160
Then I repeat for the x squared term and I
repeat for the x to the first power term.

191
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:36,370
And then I skipped some of the messy
calculations and that ended being 141.

192
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,310
If I want to evaluate

193
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:45,200
the integral of 2 Sin x over the interval
of 0 to pi

194
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:54,320
I can treat that as a constant times a
function I know how to integrate.

195
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,320
So I can move the 2 outside of the
integral sign.

196
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,078
And then in my little dictionary on the
last

197
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:03,569
slide, I had an antiderivative for sine of
x.

198
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:12,270
So that's just going to be equal to two
times minus cosign of x evaluated

199
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:18,038
between zero and pie so that's just
going to be two times minus cosign

200
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:23,620
x of pie minus, oh let me just show you,
minus cosign of zero

201
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,724
Oops, and I've done something silly

202
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:36,852
here.
So cosign

203
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:41,604
of pi is equal to 1 not

204
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:47,250
equal to 0.
So if you imagine what a cosine looks

205
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,230
like, For you it's going to start at 1.
It's going to drop, hit 0 at pi

206
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,670
over 2, and it's going to hit negative 1
at pi.

207
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,940
So this actually should have been a
negative 1 here.

208
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,419
So I would have had negative 1 minus 1.
So I would have had minus 2.

209
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,480
Times minus 2 and that would have been
equal to 4.

210
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,450
Yeah, so little typo there.

211
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,310
So this is going to be an easy one.

212
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,825
So the integral of the exponential
function from minus 1 to 1.

213
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:26,450
>> So, the exponential functions, it's
own antiderivative.

214
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,992
So, I'm going to get E to the first power
minus E

215
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:35,590
to the minus 1, which is just E minus 1
over E.

216
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,997
And that's equal to about 2.35.

217
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,370
And then the final example.

218
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:50,820
I'm just going to try and integrate, so
this is shorthand, when I type dx over x.

219
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,320
The function f of x is equal to 1/x, and
then because it's

220
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,480
an integral, I have this dx at the end,
but I multiply those together.

221
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,140
And I just write this as D X divided by X.

222
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,802
And so, in my little table of anti
derivatives, we saw

223
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:15,689
that the anti derivative of one over X was
equal to log X.

224
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:22,563
So the value of this integral is just
going to be log x evaluated at 4 minus

225
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:27,928
log x evaluated at 1.
So log of 4 minus log of 1 which

226
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:33,172
is just equal to log of 4 because of 1 is
0 and

227
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:37,249
that's equal to about 1.39.
