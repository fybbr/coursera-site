1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,031
Okay.
So we'll get started with integration.

2
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:08,931
So the problem that integration was
originally invented to

3
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:11,520
solve was, I have this function f of x.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,123
So that's the blue curve here, and then I
imagine that there's a region underneath

5
00:00:18,123 --> 00:00:24,913
my function, so it's above the x axis,
between a lower limit a an upper limit b.

6
00:00:24,913 --> 00:00:26,023
And I want to

7
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:31,253
assign some sort of area to this region s.
So, often you hear

8
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:36,978
integration just as referred to as the
problem of finding the area under a curve.

9
00:00:36,978 --> 00:00:40,190
And so the, the kind of the concept of
area, it's,

10
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,694
until there was calculus, the only way you
could the find

11
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:46,833
the area of something was figuring out how
to make it

12
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:50,576
into a rectangle and then taking the area
of that rectangle.

13
00:00:50,576 --> 00:00:51,530
And so for instance,

14
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,233
if you had two triangles and they were
both right triangels,

15
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:56,855
you could sort of fit them together and
make a rectangle.

16
00:00:56,855 --> 00:00:59,819
And then you would say, well, the area of
the triangle must be

17
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:02,674
half of that because there were two of
them that made it up.

18
00:01:02,674 --> 00:01:07,756
Here, it's going to be a little bit
trickier, because it's, even the concept

19
00:01:07,756 --> 00:01:12,704
of area is a little bit less clear when
you have a curved edge like this.

20
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,852
But the approach weâ€™re going to take is
just take a lower bound for this area and

21
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:18,697
then an upper bound for this area.

22
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:23,380
So the lower bound is going to be these
red rectangles.

23
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,922
And so, I've, I've made this diagram a
little

24
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:29,450
bit simpler just by making the curve
upwards sloping everywhere.

25
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,001
So I'm going to evaluate the height of the

26
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:36,320
rectangle at the left side of each
rectangle.

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,220
And that means that each rectangle is
completely below the curve.

28
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,870
And then I'm going to do just the opposite

29
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,030
with the black rectangle.

30
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,742
I'm going to evaluate that at the right
side.

31
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:48,270
So each black rectangle is completely
above the curve, at

32
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,160
the top of each black rectangle is
completely above the curve.

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,668
And then my lower limit for my area
underneath

34
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:56,582
this curve is going to be the sum of the

35
00:01:56,582 --> 00:01:59,288
areas of the red rectangles, and the upper
limit

36
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:02,120
is going to be the sum areas of the black
rectangles.

37
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,820
And I'm going to refer to this splitting
up of the region ab as a partition.

38
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,194
And what I want to do then is notice

39
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:18,840
I have n here as a subscript from my
partition.

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,310
So this would be p5, it's a partition into
five sub intervals.

41
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,310
And I can refine my partition just by
breaking this up at another point.

42
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,299
So, for instance, right in the middle
here,

43
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:32,190
I could add another point to my partition.

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,560
And then you're going to see that the, the
red sum

45
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,726
was going to get a little bit bigger,
because I could

46
00:02:37,726 --> 00:02:40,350
fit a little bit more red rectangle in
here.

47
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,586
And the black sum is going to get a little
bit smaller,

48
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:44,840
because I could take a little bit away
from up here.

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,230
And then the idea is to look as I make my
partition finer and finer and finer.

50
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,640
So this p sub n.

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,020
And I have n going to infinity.

52
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,669
So my, my upper limit, my upper bound for

53
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:07,930
this area is coming down as n goes to
infinity.

54
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,090
And the red rectangles, my lower bound is
going up as n goes to infinity.

55
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,050
And so I'm going to

56
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:20,394
say that if those two limits are equal.
So,

57
00:03:20,394 --> 00:03:25,940
if I, if I let my partition become finer
and finer, and finer in the limit.

58
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,550
If my lower bound is equal to my upper
bound, then I'm going to say

59
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:37,930
that the definite integral of f of x from
a to b, and I write it using.

60
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,282
So this symbol here that

61
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:46,400
I can't highlight, is integral from a to b
of f of x the x.

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,145
I'm just going to define that to be the
limit of, because these are equal, I can

63
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:53,554
pick either one, but I picked the, the

64
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:56,840
lower lower bound, and I'm going to call
that A.

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,628
And then the interpretation I get after
doing

66
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:05,660
all of this is that A can be interpreted

67
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,580
as the area of the region S.

68
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,980
And then I'm also going to say that my
function f of x is integrable.

69
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,388
And this, this condition at the end, or
this definition

70
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:22,110
means that both of these limits are equal
to one another.

71
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:29,380
If I were to continuously refine my
partition until and these limits.

72
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,508
If the upper limit stayed above the lower

73
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:36,590
limit, then f would not be an integrable
function.

74
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:42,064
So the, the notation, or the, the
definition of integrability

75
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:45,080
is that these two limits are going to
equal to one another.

76
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,520
And so, just to get used to working with
integrals.

77
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,640
So, I'll go over some basic properties.

78
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,740
So, if I look at the integral from b to a.

79
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,420
So now, I'll I've done is I've switched
the, the endpoint.

80
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,540
So, instead of my limit going from a to b,
I'm now going to go from b to a.

81
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,700
And let's pretend it's like the picture,
so a is less than b.

82
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,097
I'm just going to end up with minus the
integral, the

83
00:05:18,097 --> 00:05:20,695
definite integral from a to b of f of x.

84
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:24,199
And so in particular, it's sort of like
area, but it's

85
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,280
somehow a little bit different.

86
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,690
Because the area of a rectangle doesn't
really change.

87
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,642
And if I look at it going this way, or if

88
00:05:30,642 --> 00:05:33,690
I look at it going this way, it's the same
area.

89
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,188
But the, the value of an integral's going
to change depending

90
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:40,178
on if I'm going from left to right or
right to left.

91
00:05:40,178 --> 00:05:45,008
If I integrate a function over an interval
of width

92
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:49,378
zero, so this is just a to a, the same
point,

93
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:53,690
the value of that integral is going to be
zero.

94
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,396
So here I let c be a real-valued constant.
If I look at the

95
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:09,040
integral from a to b of c, that's just
going to be c times b minus a.

96
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,612
And if you imagine what this is going to
look like, c says my

97
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:18,100
function is constant for all x, so it's
just a, a horizontal line.

98
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,770
And I'm integrating, I'm trying to find
the area underneath that between a and b.

99
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,174
So if b is greater than a, b minus a is
going to

100
00:06:27,174 --> 00:06:32,800
be positive, that's just going to give me
the width of this region.

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,010
And then because it has a constant height,
that's just going to be a rectangle.

102
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:41,120
So all I've done here is just said width
times height is the area of a rectangle.

103
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:50,590
And then like for the derivative, we also
have a linearity property for integration.

104
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,985
So the integral from a to b of a function
that's equal to two simpler functions

105
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:59,056
added together, is just the integral of
the

106
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:03,140
first function plus the integral of the
second function.

107
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,371
Similarly, I can scale it.
So, if I have a integral of a function

108
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:19,255
f of x times a real valued constant c,
then the answer

109
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:23,850
to that is just c times the value of the
integral.

110
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,474
And now I'm going to choose a point c that
is

111
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:34,321
strictly between a and b, so I'm splitting

112
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:40,055
up the integral ab into two pieces.
And

113
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:44,105
if I integrate the function f of x over
the first piece and add that

114
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:48,080
to the integral of f of x over the second
piece, that's going to

115
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,016
be equal to the value of the integral over
the whole integral.

116
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:59,551
So as you just integral from a to c of f
of x plus the integral from c to

117
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:06,570
b of of x, is the same thing as the
integral from a to b of f of x.

118
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,755
And then if f of x is greater than or
equal to zero at every point in between a

119
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:15,410
and b, then the integral of that function
over that

120
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,900
interval has to be greater than or equal
to zero.

121
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,989
And also if f of x is greater than or
equal

122
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:29,060
to g of x at every point in the interval,
then

123
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,463
the integral of f of x over the interval
is greater

124
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:36,090
than the integral of g of x over that same
interval.

125
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:39,950
Oops.

126
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,384
And then this number 9 is essentially the
same thing I did

127
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:48,980
with my partition, except now I just have
a partition of size one.

128
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,968
All I'm saying is that if f of x is
greater than some constant m over the

129
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:59,460
entire interval and less than some
constant capital M over that interval.

130
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,322
Then I can make a lower bound and an upper
bound

131
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:07,979
for the integral by just saying that this
integral, or sorry,

132
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:12,188
this rectangle that fits entirely
underneath the curve that's going to

133
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:15,570
have an area smaller than the value of
the, the integral.

134
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,366
And this rectangle where the curve fits
entirely inside the rectangle is

135
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:26,500
going to have a value larger than the
value of the integral.

136
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,060
Okay.

137
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,840
And so, just a, a quick example of, of how

138
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,780
we can use this are principle to evaluate
an integral.

139
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:43,090
Suppose I want to evaluate the integral
from 0 to 4 of 4x minus x squared.

140
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,570
So, it's not really clear how you could do
that right from the start.

141
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:54,689
but I think if I change this function
around a little bit most of you will

142
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:56,000
recognize it.

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,960
And if you don't, I'll tell you what it is
at the end so it makes sense, hopefully.

144
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,180
So the first thing I'm going to do is just
write it backwards.

145
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,013
I want to have the x squared first.
So I'll say, minus x squared minus 4x.

146
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,350
And then I'm going to add and subtract 4.

147
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,870
So really, what I'm going to do is
underneath the

148
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,048
square root, I'm going to add 0 to this
quantity.

149
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:24,300
But I'm going to pick a very special value
of 0 that I can write the 4 minus 4.

150
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,000
And so, I'm going to put the positive 4
here And then because everything in that

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,376
quantity is going to be negative, if I put

152
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:36,370
the positive four here, that's my 4 minus
4.

153
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,394
But now,

154
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:42,130
we can recognize this as x minus 2
squared.

155
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,530
So I can rewrite, oops, what have I done?

156
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:55,528
Maybe I have to keep hitting that.
so now I can recognize this as x minus

157
00:10:55,528 --> 00:11:01,880
2 squared, the integral from 0 to 4.
And I think I have my picture here.

158
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,980
So this is what this function looks like.

159
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,255
And in fact, if you get rid of the square
root here, you think of this

160
00:11:09,255 --> 00:11:13,980
function as y equals f of x, then what
you're going to have is y squared plus

161
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,530
x minus 2 squared equals 2 squared.

162
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:23,331
Which is just the area of, or the equation
for a circle with center at 2,0.

163
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,727
And so that means that I can use my

164
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:32,064
area interpretation, because I know how to
compute the

165
00:11:32,064 --> 00:11:36,590
area of half a circle to say that the
value of this integral is equal to 2 pi.

166
00:11:40,528 --> 00:11:44,268
And just in case you forgot, at the bottom
there

167
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:48,431
I wrote the equation of a circle with
center at x0,y0.
