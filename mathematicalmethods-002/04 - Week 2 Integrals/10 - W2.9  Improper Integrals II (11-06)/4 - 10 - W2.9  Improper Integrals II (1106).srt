1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:05,010
Okay so now we'll talk a little bit about
the next type.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:13,220
So that was improper integrals where I was
looking at an infinite infinite interval.

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,610
The other possibility is that the
integrand f

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,430
of x is unbounded at either a or b.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,229
So a or b are the end points of the
interval where I want to integrate.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:25,940
And so,

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,610
if I say it's unbounded at a, what I mean
is that the limit

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:35,030
as x goes down to a of f of x is plus or
minus infinity,

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,990
so it either goes up to positive infinity
or it goes down to minus infinity,

10
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,850
and then just the same thing at at the
upper end point of the limit.

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,210
So if x is increasing towards b, if the
limit of f

12
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,160
of x goes to either, so if the function
blows up and

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,610
goes to infinity or it goes down to minus
infinity.

14
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,400
And so were going to define this in
exactly

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,770
the same way, so instead of having an
infinite

16
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,840
value in the limit were just going to
define to be the limit as so for the lower

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,020
endpoint as t goes down to a, the integral
from t to b of f of x,

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,260
or the integral goes up to b, of the
integral from a to t of f of x.

19
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,475
If those limits again exist and they're
finite, then are going to say that,

20
00:01:25,475 --> 00:01:32,590
oops didn't want that bit yet.
that this integral exists,

21
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,480
and the value of this integral is equal to
the value of this limit, or this limit.

22
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:45,650
And so this third point, is if you're
truly unlucky and it's unbounded at both

23
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,570
endpoints, what you need to do is just
choose a point somewhere in the middle.

24
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,710
And go both ways.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,950
So, what you'd be doing is splitting the
interval up into

26
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,770
two intervals and then integrating over
each one of those separately.

27
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:08,120
So, as a quick example of this guy,
imagine trying to integrate the function.

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,370
1 over the square root of x dx from 0 to
1.

29
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,930
And so the problem is as I move towards
zero, 1 over the

30
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,740
square root of x is going to get bigger
and bigger and bigger.

31
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,090
And in the limit it's going to be
infinite.

32
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,160
But I'm going to try and replace the zero
in the lower end point with

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,700
t so t in this case has to be some number
greater than zero.

34
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,580
So I'll integrate from t to one and then
it'll be easier to

35
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,930
integrate, I can use my anti power rule,
if I just write it.

36
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,804
1 over the square root of x has x to the
minus one half power.

37
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,980
And so I'll go ahead and do this integral.
And then I'll take the limit of

38
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,700
that as x goes down to 0.

39
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,152
So evaluating my integral, I just have.

40
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:08,326
2 x to the one half.

41
00:03:08,326 --> 00:03:12,770
So that's anti-derivative of x to the
minus one half.

42
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,710
And you can verify that just by taking one
half times 2

43
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,840
is 1.
Which is the coefficient here.

44
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,740
X to the one half minus 1, so x to the
minus one half.

45
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,500
And then I need to evaluate that at the
upper end

46
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,380
point and subtract and evaluate it at the
lower end point.

47
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,250
So that's going to give me 2 minus 2 times
the square root of t.

48
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,970
And now I'm going to take the limit of

49
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,370
this expression here as t deceases to
zero.

50
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,830
And so, essentially the, the second term
that has the t

51
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,910
in it, that's just going to get smaller,
and smaller and smaller.

52
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,760
So, in the limit, that's just going to end
up being equal to two.

53
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,460
So, even though this function takes on
arbitrarily

54
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,500
large values in the interval where I'm
interested

55
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,940
in integrating it, I can still come up
with a finite number For the area of it.

56
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,440
Okay,

57
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,180
and so this is this is a picture of what
it looks like.

58
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:20,190
So in this lower square here from 0, 0 to
1, 1 square,

59
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,160
that's half of the area, and then the area
where it's got this

60
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,380
curved side here, all the way up to
infinity, so, it's difficult to

61
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,095
draw something that goes all the way to
infinity so I stopped at six.

62
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,570
but that has the same area so

63
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,130
above the line, y equals 1, the yellow

64
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,460
region has the same area as this unit
square.

65
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:41,960
Here.

66
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,983
And then we can also combine both types of
improper integrals.

67
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,640
So for instance, suppose I wanted to try
to compute the integral from zero to

68
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,630
infinity of 1 over the square root of the
absolute value of x

69
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,620
minus 1.
So it has an infinity in the

70
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:12,640
it has infinitely long interval.
And also

71
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,960
when x is equal to 1, I'm going to end up
dividing by 0 and that's

72
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,980
going to be a point that's in the interior

73
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,860
of the interval where I'm trying to
integrate.

74
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,710
So the function is not only unbounded in
the positive

75
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,920
x direction it's also unbounded in the
positive y direction.

76
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,234
And so this is actually what it, what it's
going to look like.

77
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:42,350
so at, at zero it has a point of
discontinuity, it's basically the limit

78
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,390
of this function as I move towards one in
either direction is positive infinity.

79
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,660
And so, basically my approach to doing
this

80
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,270
is, I'm just going to split up the
interval.

81
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,330
So I'm going to considering integrating
this function from

82
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,230
zero to one, and then from one to two.

83
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,290
And I'll use the second type of improper
integral there

84
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,450
because that's going to help me handle
this unbounded y direction.

85
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,710
And then I'll add on the integral from two
to positive infinity.

86
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,912
And that'll be an indefinite

87
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:20,710
yeah indefinite integral of the first
type.

88
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,370
So, this is just me writing that out, so
all I'm doing is

89
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,470
splitting this up into the, so, it's the
integral from 0 to infinity.

90
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,482
I'm going to think of that as, integral
from

91
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:38,660
zero to one, integral from one to two.

92
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,690
And then integral from two to infinity.

93
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,973
But I'm going to replace all those with
the limit definitions.

94
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,980
So if this integral exists,

95
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:57,308
or for this integral to exist all three of
these limits have to exist and be finite.

96
00:06:57,308 --> 00:07:03,284
So lets just tackle them one at a time.

97
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:08,240
So for the first one if I'm

98
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,390
considering values in the interval 0, 1
then 1 minus x.

99
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,760
So remember I use to have a absolute value
down there.

100
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,390
1 minus x is going to be positive already
so I don't need the absolute value.

101
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,720
So I've gotten rid of those

102
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,671
and now this is just going to be 1 minus x
to the negative one half power.

103
00:07:29,671 --> 00:07:33,970
And when I find the anti-derivative of
that, have to remember to use

104
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,640
the chain rule because I have a negative x
inside my function here.

105
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,460
I end up finding out that that's equal to
two.

106
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,880
So hopefully that's what we would expect,
because that's what we just did.

107
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,100
So if you noticed this, this shape here is
just

108
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,360
exactly the same one we had last time,
turned around.

109
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,190
Then, I'm going to look at the, the next
bit.

110
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,740
So it's actually symmetric about one.

111
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,120
So it's not surprising that I, I end up
getting the same value, but

112
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,090
to be to be more rigorous about it, we can
go through the steps again.

113
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,950
So this time, if x is greater

114
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:22,500
than 1, then x minus 1 did I write this
backwards the second time?

115
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,930
So x minus 1 is going to be the way to get
a positive number.

116
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:34,310
So if x is greater than 1, so for instance
if it's 2, 2 minus 1 is greater than 0.

117
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:36,820
So I just flip the order around of these
guys

118
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,420
and that let's me get rid of the absolute
value.

119
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,200
And then I just take that anti-derivative.

120
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,700
So this time, I don't get the minus sign,
because

121
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,680
here I had a negative x underneath my
square root.

122
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,170
Here I have a positive x underneath my
square root.

123
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,510
So it's going to be positive.
And then I just end up,

124
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,100
once I evaluate my limit at two and t.

125
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,690
I get 2 minus 2 times the square root of t
minus 1.

126
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,720
I'm taking the limit as t goes to one.

127
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,870
So when t goes to 1 t minus 1 is

128
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,430
going to 0 so the second term is getting
arbitrarily small.

129
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,470
So in the limit I can just say that's
going to

130
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,930
be zero and I just end up with this two
again.

131
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,100
So, so far so good.

132
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,310
But now when I try and integrate my third
integral, I have

133
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:39,100
the same, the same integrand as the second
one so the first step is is pretty easy.

134
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,160
And now I'm going to evaluate it at the
upper end point.

135
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,870
And subtract, subtract this, evaluated at
the lower endpoint.

136
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:54,200
And that gives me this expression here.
But now, I have a, a t.

137
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,310
I'm, I'm no longer dividing by t.

138
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,150
The, the power of the term containing the
t.

139
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,109
So, t minus 1 is to a power greater than
zero.

140
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,700
And so this is going to get bigger as t
gets bigger and in an unbounded way.

141
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,730
So if t is going to infinity, then the

142
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,390
square root of t is also going to
infinity.

143
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:21,070
And so when I take the limit of this
expression.

144
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,313
Oops, this expression, as t goes to
infinity.

145
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:28,730
I get infinity, and so the conclusion I'm
going to

146
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,170
make from this is that the integral from
zero to

147
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,590
infinity of d x over the square root of

148
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,160
the absolute value of x minus 1 does not
exist.

149
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,580
Because when I split it up into these

150
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,930
pieces one of them was not finite.
And so then in particular, that means that

151
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:52,790
if I took the limit of this as the upper
end point goes to infinity.

152
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,820
That's not going to be finite either.

153
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,190
And our definition for an indefinite
integral existing

154
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,490
required that the value has to be finite.

155
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,200
So if this is not finite, this integral,
this indefinite integral does not exist.
