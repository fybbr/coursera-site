1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,380
The topic for week two is integrals.

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,640
And what we're going to cover in this
series of videos, first integration.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,320
So this is just the definition of an
integral.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,950
It's the problem we're trying to solve.

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,420
And it boils down to basically trying to
find the area in between a curve,

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,390
in between the, a curve representing the
graph of a function and the x axis.

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,250
The second topic, the fundamental theorem
of calculus, this gives us a mathematical

8
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,547
tool that allows us to answer the question
we, we set up in, in part one.

9
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,330
In part three, I just discuss some
applications of integration.

10
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,580
So this is sort of showing the kind of

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,330
problem you can interpret as an area and
then

12
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,190
a couple of quick examples of how you can

13
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,360
generalize that once I'm allowed to use an
integral.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,560
Then I'm going to switch to techniques of
integration.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,060
So,

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,000
like the differentiation we did in the

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
first week integration is a mathematical
operation.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,850
It's unfortunately a little bit trickier.

19
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,290
So with differentiation, we had a set of
rules that

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,330
you can apply to a function to find its
derivative.

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,750
In integration we have to run that
backwards and it's

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,050
not so clear cut exactly how that's going
to work,

23
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,910
but there are a lot of sort of rules of

24
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,150
thumb that can help you out and so that's
what

25
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,970
I mean by techniques of integration.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,930
Integration by parts, integration by
substitution and

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,880
completing the square are all techniques
of integration.

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,760
So there are tricks that are going to help
you find the integral of a function.

29
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,080
And then we'll start moving on to some
topics we'll need

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,710
to be able to take derivatives of the
Black-Scholes pricing formula.

31
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,410
So, in particular, we're going to need to
be able to take

32
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,080
the derivative of an integral.

33
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,080
So, that will be topic

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,350
number seven, different, differentiating
definite integrals.

35
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:05,550
We're also going to look at integrals that
have an unbounded region.

36
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,979
So, that would be integrating from, say a
minus infinity up to a certain value x.

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,510
We can also look at improper integrals
where the function

38
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,560
takes an inter, sorry, where the function
takes an infinite

39
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,040
value, and that will be what we talk about
in topic nine, improper integrals two.

40
00:02:23,738 --> 00:02:27,140
And then we'll put all of that together
and learn how to take

41
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,840
the derivative of a function defined to be
the improper integral of another function.
