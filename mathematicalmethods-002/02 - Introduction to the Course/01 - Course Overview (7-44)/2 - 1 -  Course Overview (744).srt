00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,440
Welcome to Mathematical Methods For
Quantitative Finance.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,290
For this first video, I'm just going to do
a

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,790
quick overview of what you can expect
during this course.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,130
So, I'm your instructor Kjell Konis.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,360
First name rhymes with cello, so cello
without the o.

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,944
For evaluation for this course, this is
something

7
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:27,730
I can't do really well in a massive
setting.

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,910
So what I've come up with are discussion
questions.

9
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,070
And so, at the end of each video, there
will be a discussion question.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,680
It should be something that if you've
understood the

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,800
video that you'll be able to answer just
within a few minutes.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,468
And then you're encouraged to share your
solution on on the forum.

13
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:50,166
And so hopefully, sort of just
organically,

14
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:54,100
there'll be some correct crowd sourced
solutions.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,790
And additionally, there'll be weekly
homework assignments.

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,531
And these will be something, these will be
more difficult problems.

17
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:02,806
So the idea will be that you watch all of
the

18
00:01:02,806 --> 00:01:05,276
videos for one particular week, and then
you

19
00:01:05,276 --> 00:01:07,920
should be able to do the homework
assignment.

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,708
It should take you probably 3 or 4 hours,
about

21
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:14,630
the same amount of time as the videos take
to watch.

22
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,670
And then there will be a due date for
these

23
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,939
homework assignments, and after the due
date, I will post solutions.

24
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,695
And again, because it's a mathematics
course, it's going

25
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:26,950
to be something that's difficult for me to
actually grade.

26
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,189
So, you'll be expected

27
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,890
to just go through the solutions and grade
yourself.

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,528
And then one last thing I, I want to
mention

29
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:39,500
at the very beginning, is Wolfram/Alpha,
this is a website.

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,363
It's a lot like Google, except

31
00:01:41,363 --> 00:01:44,690
it's for asking and answering mathematics
questions.

32
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,085
A lot of what would normally be in a first
year calculus

33
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:53,420
course or a first year linear algebra
course is some rote memorization.

34
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,955
So there're just certain functions where
you

35
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:58,360
have to memorize this is the derivative

36
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:58,900
of that.

37
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,630
I don't really want to concentrate so much

38
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,250
on just having you memorize things like
this.

39
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,666
So you can, and there are a lot of tools
on line now.

40
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,230
So my favorite right now is Wolfram Alpha.

41
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,058
And so, for simple functions, things like
sine, cosine, logarithm, you can

42
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:20,270
just ask Wolfram Alpha, and just type into
the, into the search bar.

43
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,515
You know, what is the derivative of the
logarithm and it'll think for

44
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:25,930
a couple seconds, and it'll give you the
answer.

45
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,670
So what the course is going to cover.

46
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,580
So, the numbers on the left here, these
correspond to the weeks of the course.

47
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,030
So this will be an eight week course.

48
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,610
The first week is going to be a review of
limits and derivatives.

49
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,510
The second week will be integration.

50
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,118
So, this is going to be essentially a two
week review

51
00:02:53,118 --> 00:02:57,660
of what you would normally learn in a
first year calculus course.

52
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,410
And then, we'll move onto partial
derivatives.

53
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,290
And so, partial derivative is something
you

54
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,765
can take using the same techniques that

55
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:15,008
we'll cover in week one, but it's defined
for a function of several variables.

56
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:20,166
And then multiple integrals, week 4, is
the same idea except for integration.

57
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,470
So, it's basically how you can make sense

58
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,580
of integrals of functions that take
several variables.

59
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,801
And the reason these topics are, are sort
of divided into two

60
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:34,060
bunch, bunches, so we have one through
four and then five through eight.

61
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,354
What I'm really aiming for with the first
four weeks is I want, I

62
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:38,635
want you to be able to take

63
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,610
the derivatives of the Black Shoal's
pricing formula.

64
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:44,290
And since this is a math class, really
what I'm

65
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,200
going to be focusing on is the mathematics
of this.

66
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,067
So, the Black Shoals formula is just
function of many variables.

67
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,309
And so, if you understand the, the
concepts

68
00:03:55,309 --> 00:03:57,551
that are, that we're going to cover in
these

69
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:59,793
first 4 weeks, then you're going to be
able

70
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:02,399
to take the derivative of the Black Shoals
formula.

71
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:07,838
And these derivatives are something that's
commonly known as the Greeks.

72
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:13,754
The second set of lectures is going to be
on linear algebra, Legrange

73
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:17,983
multipliers and numerical methods.
And the,

74
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:23,373
the problem I'm looking at in this second
set of the course

75
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:28,555
is something called minimum variance
portfolio.

76
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:32,181
And so it'll turn out is, when we look at
linear algebra,

77
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:34,993
we're really going to be concerning
ourselves

78
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:37,779
with solving systems of linear equations.

79
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,754
Lagrange multipliers is going to give us
the

80
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:43,650
tools we need to calculate the minimum.

81
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,866
So we want to find a portfolio of assets
that has the minimum variance.

82
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:52,454
And then it's going to turn out that when
we use this Lagrange multiplier approach,

83
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:55,760
it's going to give us a system of linear
equations that need to be solved.

84
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,880
So, we'll have done that already in weeks
five and six.

85
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,135
And then finally in week 8, I'm going to

86
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:07,050
start using something called the R
Environment for Statistical Computing.

87
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,662
It's, software program

88
00:05:08,662 --> 00:05:10,956
for working with vectors and matrices, and

89
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:14,570
also, for it's also a programming
language.

90
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,420
It's something very similar to MATLAB, if

91
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,870
you already have some experience with
that.

92
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,562
And we'll actually try and solve some
problems using a computer to do that.

93
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:28,749
So there's one recommended textbook for
this

94
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:34,069
course, it's Primer for the Mathematics

95
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:39,210
of Financial Engineering by Dan Stefanica.

96
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,570
This is a very a much more general book
than, than this course will be.

97
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,637
So this book contains several mathematical
topics as

98
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:53,370
well as the financial applications of
those topics.

99
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,226
I'm going to just choose a few of the
mathematical topics and

100
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:59,250
I'm going to focus much more on just the
mathematics and not so much

101
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,260
on the, on the financial applications.

102
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,032
And the idea being that after you do this
course, you'll be a lot ready, better

103
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,600
prepared to go on to a course where

104
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,500
they're going to focus more on the
finance.

105
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,820
And it'll be sort of like you, you sort of
learn one thing first and then the other.

106
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,403
And the idea being that will be a bit
easier for you

107
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:22,150
than trying to learn both the mathematics
and the finance in tandem.

108
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,034
And one thing that's nice about this
course,

109
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:28,610
is there's also a solutions manual which
has detailed

110
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,490
solutions for all of the homework
assignments in this book.

111
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,972
And so, I, I recommend if you, if you can
get your

112
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:38,880
hands on the textbook, that you also try
and get the solutions manual.

113
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,376
And then on your own time, try and work

114
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:45,420
through some of the, the exercises in in
the textbook.

115
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,562
And then use the solutions manual to make
sure that

116
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:50,380
you're using the right approach and
getting the right answer.

117
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,420
And the last recommended book that I
wanted to mention.

118
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,578
So this is the first year calculus book

119
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:02,960
that they use at the University of
Washington.

120
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,120
And so that's why I've put it on this
slide and have a picture of it.

121
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,616
But really any first year calculus book
will be

122
00:07:10,616 --> 00:07:13,710
sufficient, and this one is over a
thousand pages long.

123
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,960
And really what you're looking for is just
sort of and encyclopedia of calculus.

124
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,276
So that when you have questions,

125
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:20,876
you have somewhere to go and look it up.

126
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:26,008
So, Calculus, Early Transcendentals by
James Stewart.

127
00:07:26,008 --> 00:07:28,816
pretty much any edition would be
sufficient,

128
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:31,240
or any other first year calculus book.

129
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,880
But if you get your hands on a book like
that, that is going

130
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,225
to be a valuable resource for doing some
of the exercises in this class.

131
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:39,990
Okay?

132
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,830
So that's all I have for the introduction,
and

133
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,350
I hope you enjoy the rest of the course.
