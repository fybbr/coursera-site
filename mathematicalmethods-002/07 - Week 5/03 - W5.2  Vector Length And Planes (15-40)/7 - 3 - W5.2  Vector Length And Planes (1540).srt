1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:08,920
Topic two is Vector Length and Planes.
So I'll start out with length.

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,060
And the length of a vector, w, is just
going to be defined.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,760
so length of w, I'll use this notation to
mean length.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,840
So it's just these two vertical bars, sort

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,890
of like a double absolute value, and it'll
just

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,190
be the dot product of the vector with

7
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:31,170
itself, and I'm going to take the square
root.

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,640
And so if you think about the reason for
the square root, if w or something

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,009
that was actually measured in units.

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,090
Then when I did this dot product, I'm
going to have W times W.

11
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,310
So whatever unit that would be, would be
squared.

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,110
And so if I want to talk about the length
of W, if W was measured

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,550
in feet, I want this length to come back
in feet, not in squared feet.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,220
So the square root will get rid of that.

15
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,650
And In the plane, you can think about this
as just the standard

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,530
Euclidean distance between the origin and
the point described by W.

17
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,990
So for example, if W was a vector of four
components, then

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,729
the length of W is just the dot product of
W with itself.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,840
That's just going to be the sum of the
squared components.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,330
And then I'm going to take the square
root.

21
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,510
And the length of a vector is going to be
positive, except for the zero vector.

22
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,480
So remember the zero vector was a special

23
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,620
vector where every component was equal to
0.

24
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,590
And the length of 0 will be exactly equal
to

25
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,600
0 and any non 0 vector has to have
positive length.

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,570
And then there's a special vector that
useful

27
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,600
in a lot of situations that's called, unit
vector.

28
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,050
And this is just a vector whose length is
equal to 1.

29
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,540
And so if the dot product of two vectors
is equal

30
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,920
to one, then I don't have to take the
square root.

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,590
So I can just describe that as u dot u is
equal to one.

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,680
And usually that the reason the unit
vector is going to be useful is it,

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,890
is it captures the direction of a

34
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,250
vector without capturing the length of
that vector.

35
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,650
So if I have any non-zero vector, I can
find a unit vector.

36
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:36,430
So here I imagined w as a non-zero vector.
W with a little tilde above

37
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,850
it is going to be a vector that points in
the same direction but has unit length,

38
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,030
and I can turn any vector into that type

39
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,709
of unit vector, just by dividing it by its
length.

40
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,760
So W is a vector here, the length of W is
a scalar, so I'm just

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,980
using my property that one over the length
of W times W, that's also a vector.

42
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,770
Then this idea of length can be
generalized using something called a norm.

43
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,840
And so a norm is a function, I'm going to
use

44
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,140
the same notation here, that assigns a
length to a vector.

45
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,680
Here, I've put lengths in italics, because
the font that I use for these

46
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,370
slides doesn't really make italics stand
out that much I also put it in quotes.

47
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,630
So it's some quantity

48
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,139
that you can interpret like a length.

49
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,570
But it's not necessarily going to be the
euclidian

50
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,900
length of the, of the point from the
origin.

51
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,400
So a norm, to be a norm, this function has
to satisfy the following three conditions.

52
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,900
So,

53
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,540
a norm has to be, has to assign this
length quantity.

54
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,370
That's greater than or equal to zero.

55
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,360
And, it can be zero only for the zero
vector.

56
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,240
So, for a non zero vector, it has to
assign a positive length.

57
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,290
The norm of a sum of two vectors has to be

58
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,449
less than or equal to the norms of each of
those vectors.

59
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,850
And then if I scale a vector by a real
number

60
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,400
A, so remember if I have a scalar A and I

61
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,920
multiply that by a vector that gives me a
new vector

62
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,640
that just has A times the length of the
original vector.

63
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,000
And that is actually a condition that the
norm is going to enforce.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,020
So A times X, the norm of that vector has
to be equal to the absolute value of A,

65
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,080
times the same norm, of X.
And

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,690
then important class of norms, are called
the, the p norms And the definition.

67
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,510
So, if I just use this notation.

68
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,780
So, and X or any vector with the two bars
on either side.

69
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,560
I'm ging to mean the, the standard vector
norm.

70
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,740
Which is just the uclidian distance
between the origin and the point.

71
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,000
If I put a subscript here,

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,470
that's how I'm going to communicate that I

73
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,620
want this norm to be some different
function.

74
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,440
So if I put a subscript p, what I'm going
to

75
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,750
mean is this expression here, so x i,
these are the components of my vector x.

76
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:35,310
I take the absolute value of those to the
p power and I sum them up.

77
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,240
And then I pick the pith root of that.

78
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,300
So one over p is the same thing as taking
the pith root.

79
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:51,060
And the standard vector norm Is just going
to be the 2-norm, in this notation.

80
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,530
So if I put a 2 here, I would be

81
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,330
squaring each component, so I wouldn't
need the absolute values anymore.

82
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,439
So that would be the sum of the squared
components, to the

83
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,650
one-half power, which would be the same
thing as the square root.

84
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,609
So, putting p equals 2 just gives me back
the, the regular norm.

85
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:10,820
Using

86
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,040
P different value can sometimes be useful
for solving different problems.

87
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,970
You can also define something called the
infinity norm,

88
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,910
where if you take the limit of this as P

89
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,900
goes to infinity, what it ends of giving
you

90
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,360
is just the maximum of the Elements of the
vector.

91
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,830
And, then there's also something called
the 1 norm.

92
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,540
Which is just going to be the sum of

93
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,210
the absolute values of the elements of the
vector.

94
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,250
And, this is, so, in statistics, this is
sometimes called the Manhattan distance.

95
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,910
So, if you imagine, so, Manhattan.

96
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,900
Is a city that's got a grid for its
streets.

97
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,450
it can be any city I suppose that has a
nice square grid for its streets.

98
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,340
And so if you wanted to describe how to

99
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,920
get from one address to another address
you'd have

100
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,800
to think of going sort of so many avenues

101
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,199
east and west and so many streets north
and south.

102
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,350
Where, you know, the euclidean distance
would be if I

103
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,040
just wanted to walk straight at where I
want to go.

104
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,630
you know, in New York city, the buildings
are all very tall,

105
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,050
so generally you can't walk the straight
direction where you want to go.

106
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,370
Okay.
And

107
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,820
we can also talk about the angle Between
two vectors.

108
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,000
So the dot product has a nice property,
that when two vectors are perpendicular.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,070
So for instance if I thought of the vector
(1,0)

110
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,530
that would just be a vector pointing in
the X direction.

111
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,750
I could think of the vector 0,1, which

112
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,300
should be a vector pointing in the Y
direction.

113
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,560
If I took their product I would get 1
times 0 plus 0 times 1.

114
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,820
So, that's 0 plus 0 which is 0.
So, if I have 2 vectors.

115
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,650
So, this property

116
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,440
holds in general.

117
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,395
So, if I have 2 vectors that are
perpendicular,

118
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:10,777
when I take the dot product I get 0.

119
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,870
And then another little bit of knowledge
is if I define a vector V.

120
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,000
To be cosign phi, sign phi or some angle
phi.

121
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,479
Then this is always going to be a unit
vector.

122
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,810
And so I can see that just by computing
the length of V.

123
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,570
So I have cosine times cosine plus sine

124
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,820
times sine, and cosine squared plus sine
squared

125
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,880
is equal to 1, and when I take the square
root of that, I just get 1.

126
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,683
So the length of this vector V is equal to
1.

127
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,230
[SOUND]

128
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,730
So

129
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,270
I couldn't make all of this pop-up in
sequence like I normally like to.

130
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,340
So I had to just put it all on the slide
at the same time.

131
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,790
So if I define a vector U to be the vector
(1,4), so that's this black vector.

132
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:19,022
Pointing up here.
Then if I

133
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:25,900
find a unit vector pointing in the same
direction, so I can get that just by

134
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,320
dividing u by its length.

135
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:29,730
[COUGH]

136
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,600
Then the components of that unit vector
are

137
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,870
going to be the cosine of beta, sin beta.

138
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,100
So this angle here is beta.

139
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,430
And then I can do the same thing with w.

140
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,380
So here I'm just going to turn w into a
unit vector.

141
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,718
And then the components of that unit
vector are just going to be.

142
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,735
Cosine alpha,

143
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:57,120
sin alpha, so this blue angle here is
alpha.

144
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,450
And then if I look at the angle between
those two vectors, so the

145
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:08,420
angle between w and u, the cosine of that
angle, so here's I've defined that

146
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,220
to be this red angle, theta, the cosine of
that angle, is equal to

147
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,950
the dot product Of these two unit vectors,
the u tilde and the w tilde.

148
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,290
And then another nice property that I will

149
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,130
refer to later on, is called the Schwarz
inequality.

150
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,950
So it tells me that the dot product of
these two vectors u and

151
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:35,920
w, so these are the actual u and w, not
the unit vector any more.

152
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,290
This has to be less than or equal to the
length of u times the length of w.

153
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,200
And so remember when I, when I don't put
any subscript on

154
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,889
this norm operator, I mean the actual
Euclidean length of the vector.

155
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,440
OK, so now onto the second piece which was
planes.

156
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,250
So, so far, all of my examples have been

157
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,720
in two dimensions and that's mostly just
for convenience.

158
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,310
If it's two dimensional, I can draw a
picture of it,

159
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,640
and it also doesn't take up too much space
on the slide.

160
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,700
But everything, so dot products, lengths,
angle between two vectors All of

161
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,440
that's going to work in higher dimensions
too, using the same formula.

162
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,920
So a plane is a, so, when I was talking
about a plane, so

163
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,120
I had the XY plane and I had things that
lived in that plane.

164
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,060
They were lines and points.

165
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,250
Now, if I'm talking about three
dimensions, I could have a line

166
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,950
or a point or a plane that lives in my
three dimensional space.

167
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,350
So, a plane is just going to be a

168
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,760
2 dimensional sheet that lives in a 3
dimensional space.

169
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,990
So a simple example would, if I had, you
know x,

170
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,010
y and then z vertical.
I could think of x, y as defining a plane.

171
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,520
But there's no reason it needs to be flat,
you know, I could tilt

172
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,040
my plane like that or that, I could shift
my plane up and down.

173
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,160
So there can be a whole lot of planes
living in three dimensions.

174
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,540
And the way I'm going to describe a plane

175
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,560
in three dimensions, I'm going to pick a
vector n.

176
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,110
So this vector n is called a normal
vector, and I'm going to define my plane

177
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,620
to be all of the vectors that are
perpendicular to this normal vector n.

178
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,090
So, often normal means the same thing as
perpendicular in linear algebra.

179
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,570
And so if I have a vector, v, just
representing a point in my plane, p.

180
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,160
So, p is my plane.

181
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,120
And it has a normal vector, n, so there's
a, a plane,

182
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,610
and then there's a vector perpendicular to
that plane that's called n.

183
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,160
And if I took any vector in that plane and
I took the

184
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,880
dot product with the normal vector, then
by definition I should get zero.

185
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,690
Because if the vector is normal because

186
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,350
it's perpendicular to all the vectors in
the

187
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,970
plane, then my condition for a dot

188
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,979
product being zero was the vectors were
perpendicular.

189
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,520
And if I also allow 0 to be in the plane,
so this plane contains the origin,

190
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,330
so we'll generalize on that in a moment,
but

191
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,020
right now it's a plane going through the
origin.

192
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,259
Then I would have n dot 0 equal to 0.

193
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,950
And then if I had a plane now passing

194
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,240
through (x0, y0, z0), so this is just some
point

195
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,160
in space and I have a plane perpendicular
to this

196
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,810
vector n and it has to go through this
point.

197
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,460
Then, this is the equation you end up
with.

198
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,540
So, this is n dot v minus that point.

199
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,770
And, I can just write that out.
So, that's the first component of n

200
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:09,040
times x minus x,0.
Second component of n times y minus y,0.

201
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,105
And third component of n times z minus
z,0.

202
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,680
And that has to equal zero.

203
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,685
And so then what I'm going to do is just
move all of the- so the x,0,

204
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:30,440
y,0 and z,0 parts of this to the other
side of the equal sign.

205
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,500
And, when I add those up, so, nothing is
changing here.

206
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,540
The x0, y0, z0, that's a fixed, there are
three fixed numbers.

207
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:45,520
The normal vector has to stay the same,
so, n dot x0 y0

208
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,950
z0, that's just going to be a sum constant
which I called d.

209
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,510
And, so I end up with this equation.

210
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,680
So, some coefficient times x plus some
coefficient times

211
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,670
y plus some coefficient times z is equal
to d.

212
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,430
So, that's going to be the equation of a
plane with normal vector n.

213
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,250
And then, different values of d.

214
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,820
So if, if the planes are perpendicular to

215
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,010
the same vector, they're going to be
parallel.

216
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,610
So different values of d just shift the
planes

217
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,080
up and down, but they're never going to
intersect.

218
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,510
So the distance between those planes will
stay the same.

219
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,600
Oh wait, sorry.
Not the distance between the.

220
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,810
The distance between the planes is what's
changing.

221
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,489
Sort of the, the slope of the planes is
what's staying the same.

222
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,900
And then if I choose d equal to 0, that
gives me the plane through the origin.
