Topic 4 is Elimination.
So I'm going to take another look at
solving a system of equations.
So, I have x minus 2y equals 1 and 3x plus
2y equals 11.
And when I was in high school, the way
they taught me how to solve this is I
would take one of these equations and I
would solve it for one of the variables.
Then I would use that expression So if I
took this equation, I'm going to solve it
for x.
I'm going to substitute that expression
for x into the second equation.
And that's going to give me a second
equation that only
involves y.
So I can solve that and find the actual
numeric value of y.
And then I can go and plug that into my
expression
in the first equation and that gives me my
value of x.
So let's see, I did that x is equal to 2,
y plus 1 then I put the 2, y plus 1, I
substitute that into the second equation.
I solve for y and I get y equals 1.
And then I plug this y equals 1 back into
my first equation and that gives me x
equals 3.
So I end up with the 0.31 or the vector
31 being the intersection of these two
lines.
So now let's look at a more technical
approach for solving this problem.
So now I've, instead of just calling this
x, I'm going to put
a 1x here and I'm going to introduce a
little bit of terminology.
So a pivot is going to be the first
non-zero equation in a row that does
the elimination.
So when I do my substitution,
I'm using the first equation to eliminate
the x in the second equation.
So that's what I mean by the row or the
equation.
This is the equation that's going to do
the elimination.
I'm going to use this equation to
eliminate x.
And the period is going to be the first
non-zero so I'm looking at the, the
coefficients here.
The equation that's going to do the
elimination
is highlighted and the first non-zero
coefficient is this 1.
So that's why I had put a 1 here, just
that I could highlight it.
So that's going to be called the pivot.
And then I'm going to use that pivot to
work out a multiplier.
So I want to eliminate a number.
So, if I want this equation to no longer
depend on x,
then the number I want to eliminate is 3.
And my multiplier
is just going to be this number that I
want to eliminate, divided by the pivot.
So in this case, my multiplier would be 3
that
I want to eliminate divided by 1, which is
3.
And then if you think about what actually
happened
when I substituted that expression in for
x, so when I
substituted x equals 2y plus 1, this is
what I was doing.
So, I was adding negative 3x.
And so that what I'm going to do is to
take this negative 3,
with 3 as multiplier I worked out, when I
want to eliminate.
What I'm going to do is take negative my
multiplier times
the row that's doing my elimination so
that's this first row.
And I'm going to add that to the second
equation so the equation
where I'm trying to eliminate the number.
And so if you see what
happens when I multiply negative 3 times
1x, that's going to give me minus 3x.
And then when I add, 3 plus negative 3 is
going to give me 0x.
So that's what I mean by eliminating in th
co-efficiency on x in the second equation.
And then to keep the equality, I have to
do the
same operation for the rest of the, rest
of the co-efiecient.
So here I'm going to have negative 3 times
negative 2
so I'm going to have 2 plus 6.
So I have 2y plus 6y
gives me 8y and the I have to do the same
thing to the
right hand side so here I have 11 plus
negative 3 times
1 and that gives me 8.
So one elimination step or some
times it's also called an elimentry step
is just going
to be to subtract a multiple of one
equation from another.
So in this case I'm subtracting 3
times the first equation from the second
equation.
And the idea is to use elimination
to create something called an upper
triangular system.
So, so for a two by two system, we achieve
that after just doing one elimination.
So upper triangular system means that
every coefficient below the diagonal.
So here, you kind of have to imagine that
there's a matrix but I have
[NOISE]
when the row is equal to the column,
that's my diagonal.
So 1 and 8 are my diagonal elements.
Below the diagonal is just the coefficient
on this x in the second equation.
And if I can make that zero then
I'm going to call this system an upper
triangular system.
So it's only coefficients in the triangle
here that have non-zero coefficients.
And if I can do that then it's going to be
really easy
to solve for x and y using an algorithm
called back substitution.
So if a system is upper triangular, then
whatever equation's on the bottom,
it has zeroes in all of the places except
for the very last one.
So if I look at the bottom, I only ever
have to solve this.
And so in this case, I have 8y is equal to
8 and that gives me y equals 1.
And then once I know that y is equal to
one I can plug that
in here.
So I, I'll move all of the y's to this
side.
And I just end up with another upper
triangular system.
So this is a, a trivial upper
triangular system because there's just x
equals something.
[COUGH]
But if there are more variables I'll have
to
do this one time for, sort of, each
equation.
But every time, I have a very simple
equation to solve.
I only ever.
Oops.
I only ever have to solve something like
that.
So, I solve for y, then use y to solve.
Oops.
Then use y to solve for x, so I thought I
was going to actually do it but I guess I
forgot
to, so if I end up with y is equal to, so
y is equal to 1 is going to solve this.
And then I'll move this to the other side
of the equal
sign and plug in my value for y that I
just found.
And I will have
1x is equal to 1 plus 2 or x is equal to
3.
So I get the same, same solution that I
got in the previous slides.
And what we're moving towards now is can
we elimin can we represent elimination
using a matrix?
So now let's consider a slightly more
complicated system.
So now I have three equations and three
unknowns.
And I want to write that in the form a x
equals b.
So here's my system and I can write that
in matrix form.
So I have
a is a coefficient matrix, so you can
verify that it just has the same numbers
as I have coefficients over here.
The unknowns are this vector
x and then the vector b is the right hand
side, so it's the 2, 8 and 10.
Ahead of time, I'll tell you that the
solution is negative 1, 2, 2.
And so now if I think about this as a
matrix formula A x
equals b that's both the row form and the
column form of the system
And so I can either think of this as just
a.
product.
So, if I do the.
product of each row with this solution
we'll see that we get 2, 8, 10.
And I can also think of this as
multiplying A times x as this linear
combination.
So, it's the first element of x times the
first column of A plus
the second element of x times the second
column of A plus the third element
of x times the third column of A.
And that also gives me 2,8,10.
So I can represent the original equation
as
Ax equals b or the original system of
equations.
And, now let's think about what is
elimination
going to look like in terms of a matrix.
So, the first thing I want to do, I
want to
subtract 2 times the first equation from
the second.
So, I want to start eliminating.
And so, I'll use something called an
elimination matrix.
So, this looks a lot like the identity
matrix, it's zeros almost
everywhere, except for the main diagonal,
which is equal to 1.
So, if I, if this negative 2 here were
a 0, then I would just have the identity
matrix.
So mostly it's going to leave my system
alone.
Except here
this negative 2 is going to have the
effect of, so it's in the 2,1 position.
So it's in row 2, column 1.
And so that's going to subtract whatever
this value is.
So the multiplier in this case is 2.
So it's going to subtract 2 times the
first equation from the second.
And so we can see that just by
using either one of our matrix vector
multiplication pictures.
So, if I multiply, so here I'm just
looking at
the right-hand side to make the example a
little bit easier.
So, if I have 1, 0, 0.b1, b2, b3 that's
just going to give me b1.
So this matrix leaves the first element
unchanged.
Then if I say, minus 2, 1, 0 times b2, b1,
b2,
b3 that's going to give me 1 times b2
minus 2 times b1.
So it's subtracting twice whatever was in
the first row.
So twice whatever was in the first row
from the second row.
And then 0 0 1 is just going to give me b3
back, so that leaves the third row or
the third element unchanged.
And so if I multiply this by 2, 8, 10.
This is just me plugging in
2, 8, 10, for b1, b2, b3.
That gives me 2, 4, 10.
So the identity matrix has ones down the
diagonal.
So in general, an elimination matrix that
subtracts
a multiple, so this is an l right here.
A multiple l of row j from row i, it's an
identity matrix,
except it has an additional non-zero entry
equal to minus l.
And it's in the I th, J th position.
So E 3,1.
So this is going to subtract 3 times row 1
from row 3.
Is that right?
So I want to subtract a multiple of row j,
so j is the second index.
3 times row 1 from row i so from
the first index, from row 3.
And so this is just the example I did on
the previous page.
So previously I had written out the whole
form of the matrix.
Here I'm just going to say E 2, 1, so it's
subtracting.
2 times row 1, so 2 times this index from
this index.
And then, remember the identity matrix is
just leaving a vector unchanged.
