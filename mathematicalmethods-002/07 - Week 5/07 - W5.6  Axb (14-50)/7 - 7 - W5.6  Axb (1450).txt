Last time, I talked about elimination and
then I wanted to be able to do that
using matrices and I used that to motivate
my rule for matrix multiplication.
And now, I want to sort of try and put
everything together.
So really what we did in Topics 3, 4, and
5.
And I have one specific example of trying
to solve this problem Ax equals b.
So I have a, a square matrix A, an unknown
vector x, and a right-hand side b.
So where this comes from is a system of
equations.
So I want to try and solve this system of
equations on the left here.
So, 2x1 plus 4x2 minus 2x3 equals 2, and
so
on.
And I'm going to start by first writing
this out in matrix notation.
So I have, just, so what I'm going to do
is something kind of
like the idea of place value when I, when
I want to write down a number.
Just where these numbers are tells you a
lot about what they means.
So, for instance, I don't need to have
the, the variables x3 in here anymore.
Because I know if I write it organized
like
this, where the third variable is always
in the
third column, the second variable is
always in
the second column, first variable's always
in the
first column then it's clear what each of
these numbers means without having the
little x there.
So all that's important are the
coefficients
and, and then these pluses and minuses
are just going to show up as the sign of
the number in the matrix.
So I can represent this thing
here as a coefficient matrix times this
unknown vector
x, that components of x are x1, x2, x3.
And then I'm going to take the equalities,
so the numbers on the right-hand side
here,
and put those in a vector and put that on
the right-hand side over here.
So that becomes my vector B.
[COUGH]
And
now I want to be able to do elimination.
I don't want to have to be carrying two
things all the time.
So really what I'm trying to do is
introduce
zeros in these elements that are below the
diagonal.
But I also need to be, and, and I want to
do
that by adding and subtracting multiples
of one row from another.
But I also have to keep in mind that every
time I do one
of those steps, that's going to have some
effect on this right-hand side as well.
So one approach to dealing with that is I
can make something called an augmented
matrix and I'll call that A with a little
prime next to it, so A prime.
It's nothing to do with the derivative,
it's just to distinguish it from A.
And that's going to be the matrix formed
by taking the coefficient
matrix and binding this right-hand side
vector b to it.
And so that just looks like this.
And so this is really all I need when I
want to do elimination.
I don't need these xs anymore because just
the position of these numbers
in the matrix tells me what equation and
what variable they correspond to.
And now I'm going to do elimination on
this
augmented matrix, A prime and see if
I can't solve this system of linear
equations.
And so, the strategy that I'm going to
use, I want to do elimination and
I want to design each of my elimination
steps to introduce the 0 below the
diagonal.
So to get this into upper triangular form,
the diagonal elements, so it gets a
little bit trickier now when I have a
rectangular, a non-square matrix, what
does diagonal mean?
Because I would sort of think it should go
from top left to bottom right
but then it's going to miss a whole bunch
of stuff.
So, the diagonal elements of a matrix
are always the elements where the indices
match.
So, this is the first row and the first
column, this is the second
row and the second column, and this is the
third row and the third column.
So that's the diagonal regardless how many
columns and rows the matrix has.
And
what I want to do is choose pivots and and
then
elimination steps to introduce the zero
here, then here, and then here.
And then once I have this in as an upper
triangular
system, I can use the back substitution
algorithm to solve this easily.
And this time, I, I want to do this with
matrices.
So I'm going to sort of go through this in
all of its gory detail just
one time and hopefully it should be clear
what this algorithm is trying to do.
So I start out with my matrix A prime.
I guess I should highlight it down here.
I have my matrix A prime here and I want
to
introduce, I want to find a pivot in the
first row.
So that's going to be the, the definition
of a
pivot is the first non-zero value in a
row.
So if I, I start with the first row, if
this
value is not zero then that's going to be
my pivot.
In this case, it's a two, it's not zero so
I choose it as my pivot and I make it red.
Then I'm going to design an elimination
matrix that subtracts twice the first
row from the second row.
So in the case, what I, what I look at is
my pivot is 2.
This is the row doing the elimination,
this is the value I want to eliminate.
So my multiplier was this 4 divided by the
pivot so I get
a multiplier of 2.
And then an elimination matrix says, I
have to take an identity matrix and then
the 1, the, the correct index below
it, so in this case, 2 1.
I take minus the multiplier and I put that
in there.
And we know what this is suppose to do.
This is suppose to subtract twice the
first row from the second.
So if you see what I ended up with over
here, the first row stays the same
and then the second row, I have 4 minus 2,
that's going to be equal to 0.
And you always know you're going to get a
0 here because that's how you're choosing
the multiplier.
I'm choosing my multiplier specifically to
make this one number 0.
And then I have to sort of suffer the
consequences of that decision with the
rest of the matrix.
So, this 9, I'm taking this row minus
twice
the first row.
So it'll be 9 minus 2 times 4, 9 minus 8
and that'll give me a 1.
Then a negative 3 minus 2 times negative
2, so it
gets a little tricky when you have minus
signs in here.
that's actually going to be minus 3 plus 4
so I end up with a 1 in this position.
And then, 8 minus 2 times 2 gives me 4.
So that's my first elimination step.
And it was represented by this matrix E1.
And this isn't a, a standard notation,
it's just something I kind of made up
because this was getting a bit too
complicated to, to keep following through.
But essentially what I'm trying to do is I
have my first elimination matrix,
well, operate on my original augmented
matrix and
give me this matrix A1.
So this is A1 on the right over here and
it's got this 0 where I wanted it.
And then what I want to do is now come up
with
an elimination matrix E2 that's going to
turn this value into a 0.
So let's see how I do that.
So, I look at my matrix A1, oops, my pivot
is still a 2 and the number I want to get
rid of is a negative 2 so I want to, I
have a multiplier of negative 1.
And that means I actually end up adding
the third
row sorry, adding the first row to the
third row.
So in the elimination matrix, this ends up
being positive this time.
And then I can either think of this as an
elimination step, like I did last time
or I could just, well, I probably wouldn't
do it, I'd just use a computer to do it.
But you could just do the matrix
multiplication E2 times A1 and that's
going to give you this matrix that I've
called A2 on the right hand over here.
And it has exactly what I wanted to
happen.
So I, I had this 0 here already and
now I've constructed an elimination to
give me a 0 here.
And to get this into upper triangular
form, the last thing
I need to do is get rid of this one here.
And so, I've already sort of used up this
pivot, this 2 here because everything
below it is 0.
So sort of, I'm happy with this column.
So I'm going to switch to the next row and
in
the second position, so the first number
is a 0.
So my definition of a pivot
says first non-zero number in the row is
going to be the pivot.
So now, it's this 1 that's going to be the
pivot.
So I want to find the pivot in the
second row and then eliminate the values
below it.
So introduce zeros, so if I introduce a
zero below this one, then I'll be
finished.
The matrix will be an upper triangular
form, so it'll be an upper triangular
system.
So I'm going to do that with an
elimination matrix E3, 2.
And this has a multiplier of 1, that's
pretty easy because it's just 1 divided by
1.
And that says my elimination matrix, so
note that the 3, 2 here is
telling me what position to put this
multiplier in.
And then the, because it's an elimination
matrix I
want to subtract so that's going to be
minus
the multiplier goes into the 3, 2 element
and otherwise this matrix is just an
identity matrix.
So this matrix says I should subtract the
second row from the third row.
And so I can then either think of this as
an elimination
step or I can just do the matrix
multiplication E3 times A2.
And that's going to give me my a, matrix
A3 and it's done exactly what I wanted
again.
So, this was a 1, I've eliminated it with
this elimination
matrix E3 and gotten myself in upper
triangular matrix.
And then just to be complete, so I, I
picked this two in the first row, as
my first pivot.
Once I'd eliminated the 0 eliminated the
numbers below it, then I picked this
element that became my second pivot.
And even though there's still, there's
nothing left to do,
there still is a pivot in the third row as
well.
So it's just the first non-zero number
in the row becomes the pivot.
And so in this, in this case, we had three
rows and each row has
a pivot but I'll, I'll mention a little
bit later that's not always the case.
So now, it's easy to use back substitution
to solve for the values of x1, x2, and
x3.
So here, this just means 4x3, so it's
in the, it's in the 4th, sorry, the 3rd
column, the column that corresponds to x3.
And then it's equal to 8 because this 8
over here is the, the vector I sort of
bound on when I made the augmented matrix.
So that tells me x3
has to be equal to 2.
Then my second row tells me x2 plus x3 has
to be equal to 4.
So I already know what x3 is so I plug
that in and then
solve for x2, and that tells me that x2 is
also equal to 2.
And then my top row tells me that 2x1 plus
4x2 minus 2x3 has to be equal to 2 as
well.
[COUGH]
But I know x2 and x3 so I'll plug those
values in,
and then I find x1 has to be equal to
negative 1.
And so the solution x is equal to minus 1,
2, 2 so this is why it's called back
substitution.
If you notice, I ended up with this things
in
the backwards order so I got 3 then 2 then
1.
So the solution is x is the, the column
vector minus 1, 2, 2 and that solves
also the original system Ax equals b.
And then there's two
caveats and since I'm just trying to do a
quick overview of, of
Linear Algebra here, I'm not going to go
into these kind of corner cases.
But suppose when I started doing
elimination, I could still have a
perfectly
valid equation that just happened to have
a 0 on the x1 coefficient.
And in that case, this two here would've
been
a zero and I couldn't have used that value
as a pivot because I have to divide by my
pivot and obviously, I'm
not going to be able to get anywhere if I
have to divide by a 0.
So sometimes, you know, there's no
particular
reason why the columns have to be in
any particular order or sorry, why the
rows have to be in any particular order.
So you can move the rows around to get
yourself out of
this problem, so you would just pick a row
that has a non-zero
value here and use that as the first
pivot.
And so that's called making a row swap.
So sometimes you have to swap rows during
elimination.
And then the other thing is sometimes
there
will be zeros that you can't get rid of.
You need a pivot and there's only zeros.
so for instance, if you had a row that was
all zeros that would have
no pivot in it and in that case, you say
that the system is singular.
And so either you will have an infinite
number of solutions so
that would, you could imagine just two
equations for the same line.
So one row is just a, a multiple
of the other or you could have something
like 0 times
y has to equal 4, in which case, there's
no solution.
