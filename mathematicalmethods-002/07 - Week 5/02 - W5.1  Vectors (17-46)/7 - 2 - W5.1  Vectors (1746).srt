1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,010
This week's topic is Linear Algebra.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,520
It'll actually be the topic for the next
two weeks.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,270
And the focus of this course is going to
shift a little bit.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,270
So the first half, the first four weeks of

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,600
lectures, I was basically aiming at doing
a calculus review.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,480
And, getting everybody up to the level
where they were able

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,670
to Take the partial derivatives of the
black scholes pricing formulas.

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:32,560
Now what I'm sort of driving at, is a
problem from portfolio theory.

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,510
And so we're going to use tools from
linear algebra to describe a portfolio.

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,850
And then in the, in the third week.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,660
We'll look at some ways some ways to do
mathematical optimization.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,680
So for a given sort of target return

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,970
of your portfolio you'll want to minimize
the risk.

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,720
And then in the final week we'll look

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,134
at some numerical methods for solving
problems like that.

16
00:00:59,134 --> 00:01:06,330
So this week's outline today I'm going to
try and cover, topics one through five.

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,135
So, vectors, this is just points, so a
vector of length

18
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:13,630
two, you could think of that as a point in
a plane.

19
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,040
Vector of length three, you could think of
that as a point

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,630
with x, y, z coordinates and then you can
just keep going.

21
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,730
So you can have a vector in sort of five
dimensional space.

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,140
That's just

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,770
a vector with five numbers in it.

24
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:28,770
[COUGH]

25
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,920
In section two, I'll talk about vector
length

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,510
and then plane, so that's two separate
topics.

27
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,860
But they're kind of short, so I mushed
them into one video.

28
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,360
Then, we'll look at,

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,360
Solving systems of linear equations.

30
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,280
So, if I have a, three equations in three
unknowns, basically, and the way

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,300
you would normally think about this, each
one of those equations determines a plane.

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,130
Two planes will intersect in a line.

33
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,850
And then the third plane will intersect
that line in a single

34
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,110
point, and that'll be the solution to my
system of linear equations.

35
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,340
And then we'll start looking at some
concepts from

36
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,055
linear algebra that allow us to solve that
problem,

37
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:10,370
so something called elimination.

38
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,870
And then I'm going to use elimination

39
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,110
to motivate the idea of matrix
multiplication.

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,630
Then, next week we'll look at actually
solving,

41
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,850
so Ax equals b, so this is just the.

42
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,908
Matrix form of a system of linear
equations.

43
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,360
And we're going to look at solving that.

44
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,890
And sort of the moral of this set up
lectures is that

45
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,660
we can solve problems of this form Ax
equals b or

46
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,700
in general a lot, any problem coming up in
linear algebra.

47
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,460
Usually by factoring a matrix so there are

48
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,440
different ways that a matrix can be
factors.

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,950
So this is breaking it into a product of,
so a

50
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,230
set of matrices whose product is equal to
the original matrix.

51
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,240
And then hopefully that representation of
the matrix is going to

52
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,620
make it easier to solve the problem we're
trying to do.

53
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,440
And then I'm going to finish by
introducing

54
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,820
something called the R Environment for
Statistical

55
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,390
Computing, and this is a software
environment

56
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,340
that lets you manipulate vectors in
matrices.

57
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,760
And so I think a lot of these topics will
be become

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,180
a lot more clear once you actually try to
use them to

59
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,980
solve a particular problem, and that you
can do that with a

60
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,810
pen and paper but it ends up being a lot
of work.

61
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,750
And so I don't really want to stress doing
that.

62
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,430
I want to stress

63
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,480
understanding the concepts, and then
solving them using a computer.

64
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,340
The first topic will be vectors.

65
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,770
So imagine we have a, a portfolio.

66
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,419
So a portfolio's just a, a collection of
assets.

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,670
literally a portfolio just means a folder,
so it's, something like this

68
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,240
that I use to collect your quizzes at the
end of the day.

69
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,810
And I suppose in the old days, people used
to put their shares

70
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,300
into a portfolio, and so that, the word is
sort of stuck around.

71
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,600
And I'm going to consider a very simple
portfolio.

72
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,830
So I have two assets, which I cleverly

73
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,650
named asset 1 And asset 2.

74
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,900
And then I'll have w1 shares of asset 1,
and w2 shares of asset 2.

75
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,670
So, you could think of this as me, say

76
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,200
owning five shares of Apple and three
shares of Google.

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,910
Something like that.

78
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,595
But, instead of just kind of making a
list, I want to

79
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:27,330
think of this as a, something called a two
dimensional vector.

80
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:34,410
So I'm going to call my vector w, and
it'll have components w1 and w2.

81
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,770
And so, in general you want to think of a
vector

82
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,179
because our goal is to eventually combine
this with matrices.

83
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,950
So there's two ways you can write a
vector.

84
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,290
I could write it as a row, which is sort
of this way, or

85
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,796
I can write it as a column, which is this
way that's in black.

86
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:02,240
And generally, I want to think of vectors
as always being a column,

87
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,670
but sometimes just because it's
inconvenient to

88
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,160
write them, you know if I have a

89
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,100
vector of ten things it's going to take up
the whole slide just to write one line.

90
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,410
So I'll write them in a row, but I'll use
parentheses instead.

91
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,310
So, this means the same thing.

92
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,680
If it's got the square brackets, I mean
the vector

93
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,220
actually the way it's written down, and if
it's got the

94
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,720
round brackets, parentheses, then even if
I write it like

95
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,120
this, what I really mean is a column with
w1 on

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,510
top and w2 on the bottom.

97
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,360
And w1 and w2 are called the components of
the vector, w.

98
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:43,240
And so the you know simplest operation
would be addition.

99
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,400
So, suppose I had a second portfolio.

100
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,320
So I have u shares of asset 1 and u shares
of asset 2.

101
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,690
So I can have different numbers but the
interpretation has to be the same.

102
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,740
So Whatever number goes in the first
component of

103
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,180
my vector, that's the number of shares of
asset 1.

104
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,230
Whatever number goes in the second
component of my

105
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,280
vector, that's the number of shares of
asset 2.

106
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,560
And then,

107
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,410
you know, this is just two separate
portfolios.

108
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,710
If I were to put them together, it should
be pretty clear that it's going to be

109
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,780
the, the number of shares of each asset

110
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,040
that are going to be in, the combined
portfolio.

111
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,320
So I'm going to define addition just to
work like that.

112
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,560
And this isn't just addition for vectors
that

113
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,480
represent portfolios, this is, this is
addition in

114
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,750
general for vectors and I'm just trying to
use this idea of a portfolio of assets

115
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,870
to, to help you understand.

116
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,420
So if I have a vector u and a vector w,
and I add them together.

117
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,130
I'm just going to add them component-wise,
so the first component of the sum

118
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,010
is equal to the sum of the two first
components, and so on.

119
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,210
And so the, I think I already set it, but
the.

120
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,000
So to the language I want to use is
component-wise.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,140
So if I do an operation on a vector that
effects each

122
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,840
component of the vector individually, I'll
use the, the word component wise.

123
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,030
And any.

124
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,820
Suppose I want to, consider the problem of
multiplying a vector by a

125
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,600
scalar quantity, so scalar quantity is
just going to be a real number.

126
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,810
But it's a single real number, so vector
has more than one component, a scalar is

127
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,290
just one single real number so if I looked
at just multiplying

128
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:37,910
a vector by an integer, and so, 2 is a
pretty easy integer to work with.

129
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,640
Normally,

130
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,670
I would think of 2 times w as just w times
w, and so then

131
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:51,699
if I did that using my addition rule, I
would just end up with 2w1 2w2 as the sum.

132
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,980
And so in general I'm going to do the same
thing.

133
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,270
So, this scaler here that I put in front
of the

134
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,820
vector, just ends up getting multiplied
into each component of the vector.

135
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,650
So when I define multiplying a vector by a
scaler so

136
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,310
here, this value c is a scaler value, some
real number.

137
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,220
Then the answer is just going to be c

138
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,560
times the first component and c times the
second component.

139
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,000
Then I can make something called a linear
combination of two vectors.

140
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,290
So again I have a vector u and a vector w.
And

141
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,820
I, I now have two scalar quantities, c1,
ops, and c2.

142
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,780
And I'm just going to combine my scalar
rule and my addition

143
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:47,516
rule.
So c1 times u becomes cu1, c1u1,

144
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:48,720
c1u2.

145
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,650
c2w becomes c2w1 c2w2, and then I just add

146
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,350
those component wise, and so I end up with
this

147
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,168
as the expression for the first component
of this linear

148
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:04,065
combination, and this as the expression
for the second component.

149
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,967
And then one nice thing I can get out of
here is if I set c1 equal to 1,

150
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:18,780
ops, and c2 equal to minus 1.
Then I end

151
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:24,760
up with u minus w so this allows me to
define Vector subtraction.

152
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,980
And I guess I should, should mention I'm,
I'm using this vectors of length too just

153
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,810
because I want to have something to show
off that's in the form of a vector.

154
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:41,520
This works for vectors of any length just
again if they get longer it's just that

155
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,230
much more type setting for me and not much
less that will fit on the slides.

156
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,690
And so in mathematics generally people
tend to trust

157
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,540
something more if they can draw a picture
of it.

158
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,320
And so we can actually draw a picture of
vector addition.

159
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,130
So suppose a vector W So, again it's just.
I'm going to use points and the planes.

160
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:15,930
So, the vector w will have two components.
And, we'll draw that with an arrow.

161
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,090
And, I'll put the tail

162
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,824
of the arrow at the origin.

163
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:24,930
So, for any vector, the tail always goes
at the origin.

164
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,520
And then the pointy end goes at the point
w1, w2.

165
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,050
So it goes at the point whose components
are the components of the vector.

166
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,585
So for example if I let u equal the vector
1,2 and w equal the vector

167
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:46,720
3,1 then I end up with a picture like
this.

168
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,640
So, to get u, I put the tail of the

169
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,120
arrow, so that's the not pointy end at the
origin.

170
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,400
I put the pointy end at the point 1,2,

171
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,900
so this is the x coordinate, the first
component,

172
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,165
if you're describing points on the plane
you're

173
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:04,290
going to think of that as the x component.

174
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,190
And the second one will be the y
component.

175
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,700
So I just put the pointy end at 1, 2.

176
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:16,660
Same for w, I put the x at 3, and y is 1.
So the pointy end goes at the point 1, 3.

177
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,000
And then if I add these together, what
ends up

178
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,710
happening is I can think of addition as
taking one vector,

179
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,710
so for this bottom path to the sum, I can
think of that as taking this

180
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:35,470
vector u, and drawing its tail at the tip
of w.

181
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,910
So I go, w like that, and then I go u like
that, and

182
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,600
then I end up at the vector v, which is
this blue arrow here.

183
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,900
And I could have done it the other way.

184
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,820
That's a, it's an associative, I'm sorry,

185
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,500
commutative operation so I could have
taken,

186
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,140
I could have gone from here to here so
I've gone up to u.

187
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:59,340
And then taken the vector, w, and placed
it here,

188
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,230
and that would also get me to the vector,
v.

189
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:11,270
And then subtraction.
So if I start out with v, and I

190
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:16,690
want to find out what is v minus u, so I'm
aiming to do this operation right here.

191
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,120
I'll take the vector v, then minus 1 times
u.

192
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,680
So if I multiply a vector by a

193
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,150
scalar, that's just changing the length of
the arrow.

194
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,060
But it's not changing the direction that
it's pointing in.

195
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:37,640
So if I multiply it by negative one, I'm
just taking this vector, and, ops.

196
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,190
well, here, here's u.

197
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,700
It just ends up being this u, but pointing
the other direction.

198
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,320
So I would draw that from

199
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,080
the origin, down.
But since I'm doing an addition operation,

200
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,700
I move the origin from my vector, u.
To be this vector v here.

201
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:59,370
So to get w, I follow v, and then I follow
u, and I end up at w.

202
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,550
So, since each component in the sum So

203
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,940
here I'm using i to mean the components,
so

204
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,590
in my case I've been looking at vectors of
length two so I could be one or two.

205
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:26,186
So, since ui plus wi is equal to wi plus
ui because addition is commutative.

206
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,640
I have the same property for vectors.
So u plus w is equal to w plus u.

207
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,330
So that should be pretty obvious.

208
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,510
I just have 1 plus 3 is 4 or 3 plus 1 is 4
and so on.

209
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,830
There is one special vector called the
zero vector.

210
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,300
And that has each component equal to zero.

211
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,720
So every component in the vector has to be
zero.

212
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,760
And then it's going to have the same
property that zero

213
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,890
has for regular numbers if I add zero to
any vector.

214
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,340
So you have to be a little bit careful
here,

215
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,590
because the zero vector has to be the same
length.

216
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,750
As the vector w,

217
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,650
but generally if w is a vector and I add 0
to

218
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,970
it, you just sort of have to look at that
and say, well,

219
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,570
this 0, the type of 0 has to match the
type of

220
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,650
this w in order for me to be able to do
this operation.

221
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,560
So, 0 must be a vector of 0, the same
length as w.

222
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,460
And the zero vector has the same property
of zero, so if

223
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,050
I add it to any vector, I just get my
vector back.

224
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,840
If I scale a vector, so here I've used 2,

225
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,700
but in general this could be any real
number c.

226
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,800
this pres, well To preserve the direction,
it can be any real number except for zero.

227
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,940
And, if I put two here, it's going to
double the length.

228
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,830
If I put an arbitrary constant c here, it
will be c times the length.

229
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,260
And then minus u, you can think of that as
being the same length as u.

230
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,080
By just pointing in the opposite
direction.

231
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,520
So that sort of covers addition and then
these, the

232
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,540
operations of dealing working with vectors
using scalars.

233
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,410
We can also Introducing a concept

234
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:34,140
called the dot product or inner product.
And this gives us some notion of how you

235
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:42,810
could multiply two vectors together.
So if I have two vectors u and w that

236
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:48,760
are length two, the dot product is just
going to be the scalar quantity.

237
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,900
So here I'm, I'd read this left side as u
dot w.

238
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,280
And it's just defined to be

239
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,854
the product of the first component.

240
00:15:59,854 --> 00:16:03,220
The product of the first component plus
the product of the second components.

241
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,330
Or in general if this a, longer vector.
So w or length three.

242
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,490
Or length four.
Or length five.

243
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,270
It's the, the product of the, the
components with

244
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,290
the same index, and then all of those
sumed together.

245
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:24,244
So if it was length four, it would be u1w1
plus u2w2 plus u3w3 plus u4w4, and

246
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:25,750
then, all summed up.

247
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,839
And so this going to always be a real
number.

248
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,380
And just a, a scale or quantity.
It's not goig to be a vector.

249
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:43,230
So just a, a simple example.
If I take the dot product of 1, 2 and 3,1

250
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,715
I end up with 1 times 3 plus 2 times 1 so
1 times 3.

251
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:53,320
Ops, plus 2 times 1, and that'll be equal
to 5.

252
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,530
And the reason this type of product makes
sense, so again,

253
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,840
this is something we can actually

254
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,830
understand again, with my portfolio
example.

255
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,910
So remember, w was my position in assets 1
and 2.

256
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:11,130
So w1 was how many shares of asset 1 I
own.

257
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,150
And w2 was how many shares of asset 2 I
own.

258
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,390
And suppose I have another vector p1 and
p2

259
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:23,260
that are the prices of asset 1 and asset
2.

260
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:29,460
Then if I define v to be the dot product
of.

261
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,800
W and p so w dot p.

262
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,435
That's going to be the number of shares of
asset

263
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:39,710
1 times the price of asset 1 plus the
number

264
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,855
of shares in asset 2 times the price of
asset

265
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:45,610
2 and that'll just be the value of my
portfolio.
