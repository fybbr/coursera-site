00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:01,190
Hello.

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:06,260
Welcome to Week 5 for Mathematical Methods
for Quantitative Finance.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,530
So the first four weeks, we did our review
of

4
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,150
Calculus and now we're going to shift
focus to Linear Algebra.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,790
And this week's menu is going to be

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,190
Vectors.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,730
A vector is just, you can think of it as a
point in a plane.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,771
So it's just a pair of numbers x,y.

9
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:28,130
And then it also can be extended so you
could think of it as a point in three

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,230
dimensions, in which case it would be x,
y,

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,930
z that would be a vector of length three.

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,680
a point in the plane x, y would be a
vector of length two.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,240
And so we'll start off just by coming up
or, or going over the basic addition

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,630
rules and a few other things for vectors.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,670
Then in the second section, I'll go
through vector length.

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,640
So unfortunately, one of the things you
lose when you start to have points in

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,770
two dimensions is you can no longer say,
you know, x is less than y.

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,000
And so, we need another way to compare
magnitude so

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,480
we use the length of the vector to do
that.

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,130
And then I'll go and,

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,820
into just a little discussion about a
plane.

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,910
So a, a plane is basically just like a
line, but in three dimensions.

23
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,970
So it it ends up having length and width.

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,380
And then that's going to lead us into
Systems of Linear Equations.

25
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,660
And so in two dimensions, you can think of

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,610
a System of Linear Equations as just two
lines.

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,400
And what you're interested in finding is
the point where they intersect.

28
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,330
In three

29
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,890
dimensions, now we have to think of
planes.

30
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,660
So two planes would intersect in a line

31
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,490
and then a third plane would intersect
that

32
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,520
line in a point, and that will be

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,620
the solution to our system of linear
equations.

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,990
And then, we're going to start talking
about

35
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,270
how we can solve systems of linear
equations.

36
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,160
And that's going to bring us to bullet
point 4, Elimination.

37
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,470
And following from elimination, we're
going to end up being able to view the

38
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,900
problem we're trying to solve as a matrix
so a

39
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,140
matrix is just going to be a collection of
vectors.

40
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,280
And then we'll look at specifically
solving the problem Ax equals b.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:15,390
So A is a matrix, x is a vector and x is
the unknown, and then b is another vector.

42
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,300
And I want to find the vector x that
satisfies this equation.

43
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:23,450
one way to do that is use an inverse

44
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,410
matrix, so that's all we'll talk about and
section 7.

45
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,540
And essentially if

46
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,300
A is just a number, x were a number, and b
were a

47
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:37,790
number than solving Ax equals b would
involve just dividing both sides by A.

48
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,160
And so inverse of a matrix, I think of
that

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,480
as just A-inverse times A times x will
equal x.

50
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,630
And then whatever's left on the right-hand
side would be the answer A-inverse b.

51
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,689
And it turns out that in solving this a
nicer way of

52
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:56,650
doing that involves factoring the matrix.

53
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,020
And this is going to lead us into next
week's lectures.

54
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,100
So there are a lot of a lot of useful
factorizations of

55
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,020
matrices that will make seemingly
difficult problems a lot easier to solve.

56
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,040
And then I'm going to finish up by talking

57
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,500
about something called the R Environment
for Statistical Computing.

58
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,340
And that's just a software program that

59
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,160
allows you to manipulate matrices and
vectors.

60
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,780
When we

61
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,670
start dealing with this many numbers, it's
no longer practical to

62
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,920
try and do the calculations by hand on a
piece of paper.

63
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,850
So it's really useful to have a little bit
of experience, at

64
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,080
least, with a computer algebra system that
can do that for you.
