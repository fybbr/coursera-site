00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,900
So the final topic in our first set of
slides is called L'Hopital's Rule.

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,500
And this is a rule for evaluating limits.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,840
So, it's just one more little piece of
what we started on on the first session.

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,910
And so the problem that I want to look at,

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,410
is suppose I have a function that looks
like this.

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,150
So I have, sine x divided by x.

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,710
So one of my rules said that,

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,430
for a rational function I can just of this
as the

9
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,860
limit of the top divided by the limit of
the bottom.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,290
But that's not going to work here for two
reasons.

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,140
A, the limit of the bottom is going to 0.

12
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,390
So, it's a continuous function, it's going
to be 0.

13
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,400
And the limit of the top is also a
continuous function, and sign of 0 is 0.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,969
But if you plug this thing, it looks like
this.

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:04,279
So it looks like it's very well defined.
Except if I plug in the, the

16
00:01:04,279 --> 00:01:10,410
number 0 I get an undefined quantity at
exactly 0.

17
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,420
But any positive number or any negative

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,380
number it's well-defined and it looks like
this.

19
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,160
So if you wanted to, sort of, fill in fill
in the gap.

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,930
So I'm missing this one little point right
here.

21
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,770
There's a very obvious choice of what
number

22
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,550
you would want to choose to put there.

23
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,680
And so this, this is sort of the problem
if I

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,530
jsut tried to evaluate it using the rules
that I already know.

25
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,565
But that's not allowed since the
denomiator's equal to 0.

26
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,930
And so l'Hopitals Rule, let's make some
sense of this.

27
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,270
So, let x be a real number or plus or
minus infinity.

28
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,390
And let F of X and G of X be
differentiable functions.

29
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,750
And there's a lot of conditions, so this
is a little bit

30
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,010
longer than I would like it to be to fit
on a slide.

31
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,030
But basically, what it's saying is if the
limit of F of X, so this

32
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:15,620
is the thing I'm going to have on the top
of my fraction is 0.

33
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,840
And the limit of g of x, the denominator
of my fraction, is 0.

34
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,170
And if the limit of F prime

35
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,090
divided by G prime exists.

36
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,090
And that just has to be true on some
neighborhood around 0.

37
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,120
So you can imagine a point x 0.

38
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,380
And then theres A over here and B over
here.

39
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,890
So you have some, some points around X and
0.

40
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:39,890
[BLANK_AUDIO]

41
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,390
And

42
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,410
you need G prime, so the thing on the
bottom

43
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,205
has to be non-zero everywhere except at X
and 0.

44
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,580
Then, the limit of F of X over G of X, so

45
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,650
this is not the derivative anymore, this
is the two original functions.

46
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,355
So, this could be sign X divided by as X
goes to X 0 it exists

47
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:07,840
and is equal to the limit of the
derivative as x goes to x 0.

48
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:07,840
[BLANK_AUDIO]

49
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,340
And

50
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,150
I, I think this will be more clear once I
show, I show an example.

51
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,270
And then we also have pretty much the

52
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,190
same thing if I have another, a rational
function.

53
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,985
But in this, this time instead of going to
0, so

54
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:32,220
0 over 0, now it's going to infinity
divided by infinity.

55
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,830
So this is another quantity that I can't
make any sense out of mathematically.

56
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,480
but pretty much the same condition so if f
prime over g prime exists and I have this

57
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,100
So the intervals now just mean after a
certain number it has to

58
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,445
hold, so such that g prime of x is not
equal to 0.

59
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,110
Then the limit exists, so f(x) over g(x),

60
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,340
even though both of these are going to
infinity.

61
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,020
The limit exists and it's equal to the

62
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,215
same thing, just the limit of the two
derivatives.

63
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:16,066
And just a note so you can use this slide
for reference in the future.

64
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:19,820
So, if X 0 is plus or minus infinity, then

65
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,400
these intervals that I've been writing,
you know, x has to

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,910
be in the interval a b, you would just
think

67
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,030
of as minus infinity up to b or a to
infinity.

68
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,900
So the way we're going to use this is if I
want to now

69
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,010
try and make sense out of the limit sin(x)
divided by x.

70
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,900
So I have the limit of the numerator and

71
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,149
the limit of the denominator both going to
0.

72
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,060
So if I just try to evaluate this,

73
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,470
[UNKNOWN]

74
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,830
sense they both of 0.
I'm allowed to use L'Hopital's Rule.

75
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,600
So and, I can say that this limit is equal
to the limit

76
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,340
of the derivative of the numerator divided
by the derivative of the denominator.

77
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,100
So we've already shown or already said
that the derivative of sine

78
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:15,100
is cosine.
So the limit here is going to be

79
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,620
equal to the limit as x goes to 0 of cos x
divided by 1.

80
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,520
So the derivative of x is just 1.

81
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,420
And now this is a continuous function, so
I can just plug in

82
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,760
the value 0 and I get cosine of 0 is equal
to 1.

83
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,446
And if we go back quickly and look at my
picture,

84
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:40,110
that's exactly the value that I would want
to choose for this

85
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,770
function to make it continuous.

86
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,390
Oops, okay.

87
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,350
So, as another example consider x squared
minus 1 x squared plus 1.

88
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,550
And I want to look at the limit of this as
x goes to infinity.

89
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,970
So clearly the numerator is going to go to

90
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,000
infinity and the denominator is going to
go to infinity.

91
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,580
So, if both of them go to infinity I'm
allowed to use L'Hospital's Rule.

92
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,690
And that

93
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,470
tells me that this limit Is equal to the
limit of the derivative of

94
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:21,940
the numerator, divided by the derivative
of the denumerator, as X goes to infinity.

95
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,760
And so when I take the derivative of the
top, the derivative

96
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,740
of the minus one, ones constant, so that's
just going to be 0.

97
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,780
And the power rule says the derivative of
X squared is 2X.

98
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,790
So I'm going to end up with the

99
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,490
limit as x goes to infinity of 2x divided
by 2x.

100
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:53,006
But still, I can't this isn't continuous,
at the point where I want to or I'm sorry.

101
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:53,653
Eh-heh.

102
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:54,880
I'm not going to 0.

103
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,710
I'm going to infinity now.

104
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,530
So, still if I look at the limits here,
the limit of

105
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:04,688
2x divided by the limit of 2x, as x goes
to infinity.

106
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:08,350
So I'm kind of struggling here to show you
that you

107
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,710
can use L'Hospital's Rule twice to get the
same thing.

108
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,889
You could just cancel the x's here and be
finished.

109
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,332
but the idea here is end up after one
application of

110
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:23,900
L'Hospital's Rule with another rational
function that's still 0 over 0.

111
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,050
Or infinity over infinity.

112
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,281
Then I can go ahead and use L'Hospital's
Rule again.

113
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,630
And so I, I end up with where I was
before.

114
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,000
Take the derivative one more time, so now
I end up with 2

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,400
over 2, and that's always going to be
equal to 1, regardless of x.

116
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,813
So the limit as x goes to infinity of
that, is going to be 1.
