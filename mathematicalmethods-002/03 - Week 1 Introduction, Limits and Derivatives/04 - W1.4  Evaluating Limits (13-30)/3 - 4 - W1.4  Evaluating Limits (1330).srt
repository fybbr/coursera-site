1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,890
Next section is evaluating limits.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,764
So I'll start off by just pointing out

3
00:00:06,764 --> 00:00:09,050
working with the definition is not very
fun.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,690
So luckily there are a lot of rules that
you can use.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,030
I'm just pretty much here just going to
try and list them off.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,029
These slides are more meant to be a
reference.

7
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:25,906
you probably would be able to find these
know, I, I just Google for stuff most of

8
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,254
the time.

9
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:30,600
but, it would be in the first year
calculus text book.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,540
That I think that's where I found most of
these rules.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,660
So, I'm going to suppose that C is a real
valued constant.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,340
And that the limits, as X goes to A of F
of X.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,100
And as X goes to A of G of X, both exist.

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,740
So, they don't necessarily need to be
finite, but they

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,870
need to be something that I can make sense
of.

16
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,910
So they can't be 0 divided by 0.
Infinity divided by 0.

17
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,460
Infinity divided by infinity, things like
that.

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,570
Then, so we have a linearity property.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,960
So if I have a function that I can see is,
you

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,240
know, made up of two sub functions, so f
of x plus

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,520
g of x, and I'm looking at the limit of
that, and

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,889
the limit of a sum is equal to the sum of
the limits.

23
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,910
Similarly if I scale my function, so here
my function is f of x, I'm going to

24
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:32,480
multiply that by my constant c, so c could
be anything.

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,288
It could, if I want to double function it
would be to 2 f of x and so on.

26
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:42,730
the limit as x goes to a of c times f of
x.

27
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,994
Is just c times the limit of oops, c times
the limit of f of

28
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:53,264
x as x goes to a.
So I think most of these are pretty

29
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:57,449
intuitive, but they are all things that
are proved in

30
00:01:57,449 --> 00:02:02,370
a calculus textbook so, you know, you can
use them.

31
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:07,044
The limit of a product, the limit as X
goes to A of F

32
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:12,070
of X times G of X is equal to the product
of the limit.

33
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,220
So, here I have the limit of F of X as X

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,475
goes to A and the limit of G of X as X
goes

35
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:19,060
to A.

36
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,580
And I'm going to multiply those two
numbers

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,028
together and that's going to be the same
as

38
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:29,028
the limit of the product of these
functions going when as x goes to a.

39
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:34,370
also works for rational functions.
So,

40
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,650
the limit as x goes to a of f of x divided
by g of x is just going

41
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,000
to be equal to the limit of f of x divided
by the limit.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,206
Of g of x as x goes to a, we have to make
one, one little copy it here

43
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:57,525
So the, oops, so the limit as x goes to a
of g of x can't be equal to 0.

44
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,214
And then finally

45
00:03:06,214 --> 00:03:11,270
So here this little

46
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,330
thing here is an n.

47
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,511
So if it was square root, that would be a

48
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:27,041
two, three would be a cube root and so on.

49
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,100
And then if P(x) and Q(x) are polynomials
and

50
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,976
c is a real constant that's greater than
one.

51
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:38,736
So by, by polynomial I just mean this is
equal to

52
00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:43,716
something like P(x) would be ax squared
plus bx plus c.

53
00:03:43,716 --> 00:03:48,360
but it can be arbitrarily large orders, so
you know

54
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,004
the first one could be x to the thousand
or something

55
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:54,159
like that.

56
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:02,692
Then the limit as X goes to infinity of
any polynomial divided by c to the x.

57
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:07,392
And I could also write that as the limit
of any polynomial

58
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:11,430
times c to the negative x is going to be
equal to 0.

59
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,260
So it doesn't matter how big the order of
this polynomial is.

60
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,404
Even if I have x to the thousandth, if I'm
dividing it by a constant

61
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:22,854
raise to some power.
That's eventually

62
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:27,434
going to go to 0.
And then kind of a, a similar result If I

63
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:32,738
take the log of the absolute value -- so I
need the absolute value just because of

64
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:37,730
how log is defined know, it's not going to
work very well if I give it a negative

65
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:43,658
number.
the log of any polynomial divided

66
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,670
by any polynomial.

67
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,095
If I take the limit as x goes to infinity,
that's also going to be 0.

68
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,949
And so, just some, some examples.
If I had x squared times e to the minus x.

69
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,285
Now x squared is something that would grow

70
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:03,755
arbitrarily large as x goes to infinity,
but

71
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:05,705
e to the minus x is something that's

72
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,930
going to be getting smaller as x goes to
infinity.

73
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,374
But, because this, this part of the
product has the

74
00:05:13,374 --> 00:05:17,515
x in the exponent, but here, it's in the
base,

75
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:23,640
this term is going to dominate and so the,
the limit is going to go to 0.

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,900
[BLANK_AUDIO]

77
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,200
And then as an example of, of the second
result if I have the log of x cubed

78
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,790
and here the cubed doesn't really matter.
I put any power here.

79
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,780
I could put 1,000, 10,000.

80
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,470
Eventually, as x goes, you know, as x gets
large, as x goes to infinity, this

81
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:49,090
x in the denominator is going to dominate
because of the logarithm on the top here.

82
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,930
And this limit

83
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,775
will go to 0.

84
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,550
And I'm going to add a little bit more
notation.

85
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,650
So If I instead of using my arrow, my goes
to arrow, as just a horizontal

86
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,790
arrow, so that means goes to a value but I
don't care how I get there.

87
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,140
I just have to be getting closer.

88
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,730
But I could be bouncing from side to side
if I wanted to, to get there.

89
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,083
If I use this down arrow, I'm going to
mean that x goes to 0.

90
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,325
With X

91
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:21,774
always being greater then 0 so it can

92
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:24,697
bounce around a little bit but I'm
starting

93
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:26,751
only on one side of the value and

94
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:30,350
moving towards my limiting point from only
one side.

95
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,047
And also just encase you never seen this
notation before the K followed by

96
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:40,970
a exclamation point is read K factorial
and it just means k times k minus1.

97
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,454
Sorry, it's defined for integer values,
positive integer

98
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:45,250
values of k.

99
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:52,290
It means k times k minus 1 times k minus 2
and so on, times two, times one.

100
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,340
And then one factorial and zero factorial
are both equal to one.

101
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,348
[BLANK_AUDIO]

102
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:03,100
And then again, we'll, let's see the
positive constant.

103
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,212
Then if I look at C to the 1 over X, so,

104
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:14,590
you can sort of think of, kind of
intuitively what's going to happen here.

105
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,749
1 over X as X gets large is going to get
closer and closer to 0.

106
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,220
And c to a 0 should be anything to the 0.

107
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,590
Power should be 1.

108
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,904
So it makes sense that this this function,
it's limit should be going to 1.

109
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:32,114
also x to the

110
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:34,120
1 over x.

111
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,830
So even if my base is getting bigger
linearly.

112
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,150
The limit of this as x goes to inifity is
still going to be equal to one.

113
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,315
And then if x goes down to 0, x to the x

114
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:54,610
power, this limit is also equal to one.

115
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:58,660
[COUGH]

116
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,104
If k is a positive integer, and if c is
greater than

117
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:06,122
0, or if c is greater than 0 is a positive
constant, then

118
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:08,992
k to the 1 over k, so this is just a the
same

119
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:14,659
thing as a in the second bullet point just
re expressed using integers.

120
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,762
So the only difference between the, the
second set and

121
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:26,042
the top set is just now I'm sort of
restricting k

122
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:28,550
to be integer values, so it makes sense
that we would

123
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,091
get the same, same sort of result that we
got above.

124
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:35,900
And then al so what this is

125
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,396
telling us is this factorial

126
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:46,205
function defined here,

127
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:52,860
this is getting big very quickly.

128
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,380
It's getting bigger faster.
Then a constant to an exponentail power.

129
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:02,348
So, you know, our previous record holder
for how could something get big fast was

130
00:09:02,348 --> 00:09:08,280
this exponential function.
But that's dominated by this factorial.

131
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,820
So somehow this factorial's growing even
faster than that.

132
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,570
So I have two examples in the slides.

133
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,939
I'll just go through the first one and
then the second one you can take a

134
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:30,320
look at one your own because I need to
speed up this session a little bit.

135
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,689
So I want to evaluate this limit 1 over
the square root of x squared

136
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:40,861
minus 4x plus 1 and then minus x.
And so basically the

137
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:44,956
strategy you use to evaluate a limit like
this you want to get the square root out

138
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:49,147
of the, out of the denominator.
So the first step I'm going to take.

139
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:54,607
If I have minus X here And

140
00:09:54,607 --> 00:10:01,159
then I'm going to get minus X,

141
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:06,892
oops, minus X times this

142
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:11,533
square root and then

143
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:16,174
also, oops, plus X

144
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:22,190
times that square root.

145
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,940
So I've got minus something plus the same

146
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,720
thing and they're going to cancel each
other out.

147
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,010
And then in the last bit, I'll have minus
x times postive X.

148
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,880
So that's going to give me a minus x
squared.

149
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,550
And then I'll pick, pick up this thing in
the numerator of, of my fraction.

150
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:44,390
And now I have x squared minus x xquared.

151
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,070
So get rid of that.

152
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,050
Oops, I was supposed to put a little pause
here.

153
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,906
So on the bottom I just have the plus 1

154
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:57,718
minus 4x, and to help me make a little bit
of

155
00:10:57,718 --> 00:11:00,682
sense out of that, what I'm going to do is
just

156
00:11:00,682 --> 00:11:04,690
multiply the top and the bottom by 1
divided by x.

157
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,428
And that's a safe thing to do, because I'm

158
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:10,650
looking at the limit as x goes to
infinity.

159
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,688
So infinity is a long way from 0, and

160
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:18,098
the only time I would have trouble
dividing something

161
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:20,580
by x, is when x is equal to 0.

162
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,480
And so this 1 over x is going to get
multiplied by x here, and then

163
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,920
it's going to show up as a 1 over x
squared under this square root sign.

164
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,700
So what I end up with is the x squared,
square root of x

165
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,950
squared, or x squared times 1 over x
squared, that gives me the 1.

166
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,140
The minus 4x becomes 4 divided by

167
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:50,030
x, and then the positive 1 becomes 1 over,
1 over x squared.

168
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,730
And then my x gets multiplied by one over
x, just give me a one.

169
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,240
And then in the denominator I get a one
over x and a minus 4.

170
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,350
And now what I'm going to do, this is sort
of

171
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:08,526
two steps in one.
So, I can take

172
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:12,597
this limit And because this is a rational
function

173
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:15,350
Ii can put the limit on the top and
bottom.

174
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,446
And then also because I have the square
root

175
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,890
I can put this limit inside my square root
sign.

176
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,390
And then it should be pretty clear what's
going to happen.

177
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:31,510
When I look at this as x gets bigger, 1
over x squared is going get very small.

178
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,850
4 over x is going to get very small,

179
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,980
but this 1 is always going to stay the
same.

180
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,550
So this is going to become 1, square root
of 1.

181
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,138
And on the bottom, my 1 over x is going to
get very

182
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:48,790
small, but my negative 4 is always going
to stay the same.

183
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,419
So I'm going to get 1 plus 1 divided

184
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:57,470
by negative 4, which is equal to negative
1/2.

185
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,484
And then just this

186
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:04,680
is almost exactly the same example so,
here I had minus x.

187
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,770
Oops, which I can't seem to select for
some reason.

188
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,580
Here I have minus x plus 2.

189
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,926
But if you go through that and I'm doing
exactly the same trick in

190
00:13:18,926 --> 00:13:24,668
this case just by adding this little plus
two here has made the value of

191
00:13:24,668 --> 00:13:28,460
the limit divergent now.
So it goes to minus infinity.
