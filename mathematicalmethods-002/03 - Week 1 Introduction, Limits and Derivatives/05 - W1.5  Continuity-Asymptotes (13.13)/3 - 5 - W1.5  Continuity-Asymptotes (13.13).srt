1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:07,500
Okay, and then onto the last section which
is continuity and asymptotes.

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,300
So most of the time when we have a
function F of X, if I take the limit

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,340
of that function as X goes to A then
that's going to be equal to F of A.

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,860
And, and in fact you know, sometimes it's

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,880
hard to imagine why that would not be
true.

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,500
I'll show you one, one picture in a
second.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,170
But if you think about the, the quiz
question you just did, that is actually

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:35,960
well defined.

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,810
or sorry, there's a very good choice of a
number

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,850
to choose for that when x is equal to one.

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,980
But the function's not defined at one.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,490
And so this is kind of the indea of
continuity.

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,410
If this blue curve is my function f of x

14
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,060
then you can think of it as a function's
continuous.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,890
If I could draw the curve associated with
that function without lifting my pencil

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,905
off the piece of paper.
And so if I, if I have a point A on the

17
00:01:06,905 --> 00:01:12,680
X-axis and input A, and if I just move
along the curve until I get to A,

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,791
then the value of that point should be
equal to f(a).

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,850
And so that's actually the concept of
continuity.

20
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,180
That's the definition of continuity.
So we say a function f is continuous at a

21
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:34,670
point a if the limit as x goes to a of my
function f of x is equal to f of a.

22
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,550
And then we can be a little bit, a little
bit more precise about this.

23
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:48,410
So we say a function is right continuous
if as I look at points that are greater

24
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:55,440
than a and kind of moved down towards a,
the limit of f of x is equal to f of a.

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,820
And then we have the same idea.

26
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:04,150
The function is left continuous at A.
If, if I look at points,

27
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:10,950
less than A and move towards A the limit
as f of x goes up to A is equal to f of a.

28
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,940
And so clearly if a function is continuous

29
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,759
it's going to be both right continuous and
left continuous.

30
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,310
And then we'll also say a function is
continuous

31
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,790
on an interval, so I named my interval c,
d.

32
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,830
So that's just the lower limit c, up to an
upper limit,

33
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,660
d if it is continuous at every point to a,
in that interval.

34
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,650
And so this Is kind of an idea of what a
discontinuity would look like.

35
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,330
So if there's a jump in the function for
one reason or another.

36
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,180
So this is pretty much the same thing I
had on the last slide.

37
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,440
It's just at this point a, I decided to
add a little bit to f of x.

38
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,930
So that explains this jump here.

39
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:03,240
And then the open circle means that I
follow this curve up to every point that's

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,470
less than A, but not A itself and then
this solid circle

41
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,250
means that I start at A and for every
point greater than A.

42
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,510
So, if the solid circle were down here and
the open circle would have to be

43
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,040
up here because the function can only be

44
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,120
defined To be one value at any given
input.

45
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,840
And that's just going to affect the, the
definition of whether it's left or right

46
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,510
continuous at that point.
So here is f of x continuous at a.

47
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,680
And I would say no, because if I look at
the limit as I go.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,570
Towards A over here if.
I was bouncing back and forth.

49
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,880
You know sometimes I'm going to be quite a
bit

50
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,910
less than the function value, no matter
how thin I make

51
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,498
my interval, am always going to be able
to, and if I choose an epsilon

52
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:04,660
that makes a Range around this solid dot.

53
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,910
Say halfway in between the open circle and
the filled in circle.

54
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm never going to be able to get any
points on this side, into that range.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,350
So it's

56
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,570
definitely the limit as I approach a from
the left hand side,

57
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,110
it's going to be less than the value of
the function there.

58
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,240
So it's not continuous.

59
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,290
Is it right continuous?

60
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,000
So if I forget about this lower curve and
only look at

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,950
the stuff on the, the right hand curve,
you know, as I

62
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,120
move down since I've defined my function
to be the value of

63
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,139
the top curve at A it is going to be right
continuous.

64
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,270
But the reason that it's not continuous is
that it's not left continuous.

65
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,770
So as I approach this point a from the
left, the limit is

66
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,670
this open circle but the value of the
function is the filled in circle.

67
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,500
So that's the sort of the way we want to

68
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,630
give a rigorous definition to this idea of
Of continuity.

69
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,760
And so then again in a first-year calculus
text book, you're going to

70
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,290
be able to find lots of theorems about
when is a function continuous.

71
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,990
And so I'm just going to list off a lot of
these very quickly.

72
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,050
So, let f and g be continuous functions.

73
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,900
So they're continuous at a point a.

74
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,490
And again, c is just going to be a real
value constant.

75
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,880
So the sum of two continuous functions is
continuous.

76
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,780
The difference of two continuous function
is continuous.

77
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,100
If I multiply a continuous function by a
real

78
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,680
value, that's also going to give me a
continuous function.

79
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,010
If I take the product of two

80
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,820
continuous functions, that's going to be a
continuous function.

81
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:54,520
And as long as the denominator is not
equal to zero at the point A,

82
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,539
then the ratio of two continuous functions
is also going to be continuous.

83
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,510
And again, this is, this is a point wise

84
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,310
definition so this is only continuous as a
point A,

85
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,230
so all of these have to hold on an entire

86
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,330
interval for these functions to be
continuous on that interval.

87
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,310
Any polynomial, so, 1 useful interval is
R, that's all of the real

88
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,230
numbers, so everything greater than
negative

89
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,310
infinite and everything less than positive
infinite.

90
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,210
Any polynomial is continuous on the real
numbers.

91
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,600
And then the following functions are
continuous on their domains,

92
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,990
so the domain is just where the function
is defined.

93
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,120
So sometimes you have to be a little bit
careful, like if you

94
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,149
have the logarhythm, that's not going to
be defined for a negative number.

95
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,900
So like I said, a polynomial is continuous
on the entire real line.

96
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,630
So it's its domain is a entire set of real
numbers.

97
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,360
So it's continuous on its domain.

98
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,740
Trigonometric functions, so this is sines,
cosines, tangents, things like that.

99
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,840
You have to be a little bit careful
because sometimes

100
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,470
you end up Dividign by 0 for instance
without tangent.

101
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,400
But if you're not dividign by 0 it's going
to be continuous.

102
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,220
Rational functions so that was things like
f over g.

103
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,990
Inverse trigonometric functions, so this
is, you know if I say the sine of an angle

104
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:23,570
is a certain vaule.

105
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,990
I can do something called the arc sine of
that value.

106
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,420
Is going to give me that angle up to some
sort of multiplicity.

107
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:37,220
And so it's going to be continuous on the
right domain, and range.

108
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,160
The square root or cubed root, something
like that.

109
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,970
Exponential functions, and logarithmic
function.

110
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,060
So you can see from this set of sort

111
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,300
of seven things, there's probably not very
much that you

112
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,860
would normally be able to write down
that's not

113
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,970
going to be continuous at least on some,
on some domain.

114
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,390
And then also if you have a function of a
function so if g is a continuous function

115
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:15,400
and sorry if g is continuous at a, And
there's going to be a value g of a.

116
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,450
If f is continuous at that value g of

117
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:24,950
a, then whoops, f, so this, this means
composed with.

118
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,480
And the, probably the easier way to think
about it is just

119
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,710
f of g of x.

120
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,710
[INAUDIBLE]

121
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,710
.

122
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,900
That's also going to be a continuous at
the point A.

123
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,530
And so just a, a quick example.
where is the following continuous?

124
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:48,363
So it's log of x plus, arc tangent of x
divided by x squared minus 1.

125
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,590
So, this is a bit confusing sometimes.

126
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,840
Because if I put a 2 there, generally I
mean tangent squared.

127
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,440
If I put a negative 1 there, I mean 1 over
tangent, I mean arc-tangent, usually.

128
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,400
So, I would say, best to avoid this
notation.

129
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,920
Use arc tangent.

130
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,020
And if you need that to be a power just

131
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,840
write it as 1 over tangent squared or
something like that.

132
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,980
So this second bullet point is just

133
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,540
a little diversion to explain this, this
tangent.

134
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,460
Which I think basically was invented
because it fit nicely on calculator keys.

135
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:38,680
So, I'll first got a look at the numerator
here.

136
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,620
So I have log(x).

137
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,200
That's going to be continuous on its
domain, 'cause log is

138
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:50,190
a logarithmic function and its domain is
x>0 and arctan(x)

139
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,490
is going to be continuous For any X in the
real numbers.

140
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,170
So, the numerator is going to be
continuous for

141
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,880
any X in the interval from zero to
infinity.

142
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,080
Now I'm going to look at the denominator
Oops.

143
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,600
So x squared minus 1.

144
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,620
Well this is a polynomial.

145
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,290
We said polynomials were going to be
continuous on

146
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,310
all of the real numbers so this is
continuous everywhere.

147
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,889
And so f of x is then going to be
continuous.

148
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,890
Everywhere except where the bottom is
equal to zero.

149
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:42,630
So that was my one condition for a
rational function to be continuous, So X

150
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:49,190
squared minus one is going to be equal to
zero only when X is equal to one.

151
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,390
One or negative one, except that we're
really only considering Zero

152
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,160
to infinity because of the numerator.

153
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,720
So, the only point where I'm going to have
a problem is the x equal to 1.

154
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,180
And so that tells me that f of x is

155
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,110
going to be continuous on the intervals
0,1 and 1 infinity.

156
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:13,270
And by using the parentheses here I mean
zero one.

157
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,470
So every number that's greater than zero
and

158
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,640
less than one, but not zero or one itself.

159
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:18,810
If

160
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,650
I want to include the endpoints in my
interval, then I use square brackets.

161
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,420
And so basically, it's continuous on this
interval,

162
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,220
except when x is exactly equal to one.

163
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,750
And then just one last thing that I want
to stick somewhere in the course

164
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,840
and this is where I think it fits best is
the idea of a horizontal asymptote.

165
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,240
And so basically what I'm plotting here Is

166
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,850
this rational function X squared minus one
divided by

167
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,030
X squared plus one and I want to know what
happens to that as X becomes large.

168
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,730
And if you think about it,

169
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,600
you know, when, when X is small sort of
minus one

170
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,650
divided by one is going to be the dominant
part of this

171
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,560
but when X is big, like if X were 1,000
It's

172
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,690
going to be a million minus one divided by
a million plus one.

173
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,230
So it's going to be pretty close to one.

174
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,590
And so the definition of this red line.

175
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:29,770
So if I have, if I look at the limit as x
goes to infinity of f of x.

176
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:34,160
If that approach is some finite value,
then I'm going to say that this

177
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,610
function, f of x, has a horizontal
asymptote at that, at that value.

178
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,590
And the way I've, the way I've written
this, or

179
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:46,150
the way I've designed this example, you
get the same value

180
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,250
if I go Do plus infinity or minus

181
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,510
infinity, that doesn't necessarily have to
be the case.

182
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,750
So this L here doesn't necessarily need to
be the same as this L here.

183
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:02,120
And so this line is called the horizontal
asymptote,

184
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,530
if the limit as X goes to infinity is

185
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:10,390
equal to L Or if the limit, as x goes to
minus infinity, is equal to a different L.
