1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,750
The next section is higher derivatives.

2
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm going to start out with just a little
motivation

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,990
of the type of problem we're, we're trying
to solve.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,900
So, a utility function and this is a
special type of

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,250
function that shows up in economics Is a
real value function, u of x.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,840
So I'm just going to call it u, because
it's a utility, defined for real numbers.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,390
And the idea is, it's going to help us
compare wealth levels.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:43,410
And so basically, if If U of x is greater
than u of y, so x and y

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,970
are some sort of wealth, so you could
think

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,710
of that as maybe income, maybe a payment
from something.

11
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,810
Then u of x is preferred.

12
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,800
And so it's basically kind of telling me
Let's see.

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,420
Well, I have some pictures and that, that
will hopefully make it a bit

14
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,010
more clear.

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,280
So, some common utility functions are
exponential utility.

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,900
So, it has a parameter A is greater than
0.

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,970
Logarithmic utility, so it's just the log
of my wealth level.

18
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,680
power rule, so that it's b times x to the
b.

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,265
So it's sort of a, like a polynomial
function.

20
00:01:28,265 --> 00:01:37,570
And quadratic, which is defined to be x
minus bx for some number b greater than 0.

21
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,222
And just to sort of help visualize, this
is what they look like.

22
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:45,360
So the, the actual value of the utility
isn't important.

23
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,320
But what's, what is important is just how
I'm

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,980
going to compare things that are on this
curve.

25
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,380
So if I look, for instance, at this
logarithmic utility here.

26
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,810
And if I'm over on the left side, just a
small increase

27
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:08,740
in, in the x variable is going to give me
a pretty big increase in utility.

28
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,400
Whereas if I looked at say the

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,010
right side of this power rule

30
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,765
You know, the same size increase in x is

31
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:21,660
going to give me a much smaller increase
in my utility.

32
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,280
So where these things pop up is if

33
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,780
you're trying to do something like
planning for retirement.

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,340
You know, having enough money just to
survive every

35
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,870
year in retirement that gets you the most
utility.

36
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,950
You have to be able to pay for your house,
pay for

37
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,890
your food, pay your bills that's You know,
if you don't have

38
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,670
that, you're going to have a really bad
retirement.

39
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,270
You know, if you get up on the right hand

40
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,050
side where you start to have a lot of
wealth.

41
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,938
You know, you already have a boat, do you
really need an air strip too?

42
00:02:48,938 --> 00:02:50,990
You know, you already have a boat, do you
really need an Air strip too?

43
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,140
You know, you already have a boat, do you
really need an Airstream too?

44
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,990
And so, the particular utility function
that I'm going to, to

45
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,300
consider for the rest of this little
lesson, is the quadratic utility.

46
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,470
And so normally when you're looking at
utility

47
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,080
functions you want them to be non
decreasing.

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,680
So you don't ever want to get to a point
like I've drawn here.

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,410
Where if I was on this little bit of the
quadratic

50
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,170
utility function, I actually add more
wealth and I'm somehow worse off.

51
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,850
And so what you need to do is be able to
find the maximum of this function.

52
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,610
And I, I suppose, you know, maybe if

53
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,340
you know, maybe if I was at a restaurant
or

54
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,520
something and I was putting food on the x
axis.

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,020
There would be some point were I was
pretty happy.

56
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,990
And then if I continued to eat I probably
would be less happy.

57
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:44,500
maybe that would be a good example of this
quadratic function, but generally From

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,690
from just a purely economic point of view,
you want them to be non-decreasing.

59
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,250
So what you would want to do with this
quadratic one is

60
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,030
you would want to find out where it gets
to the very top.

61
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,680
And then, probably at that point, just say
beyond

62
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,220
that, the utility is just constant at that
level.

63
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,720
Oops.

64
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,410
So.
Oh, so what is the derivative telling us?

65
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,608
And that's what I was trying to get at a
little bit before when.

66
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:08,290
You know If this curve is steep.

67
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,880
So the derivative is telling us what is
the slope of this curve at a point.

68
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,310
So if the derivative is large it means the
curve is steep, it

69
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,440
means that a little bit more wealth gives
us a lot more utility.

70
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,050
Whereas, if I'm over here a little bit
more wealth, hardly gives me any utility.

71
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,530
So that's the, the derivatives is I'm
going to give me sort of

72
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,018
the relative change in utility for one
more dollar worth of wealth.

73
00:04:36,018 --> 00:04:41,860
And so now if I go back to my,

74
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:48,650
my quadratic utility, I want to find a
point where I'm at the top of this thing.

75
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,350
And so, the way I'm going to know I'm at
the top, you know, if I'm walking

76
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,920
up a hill, I walk up the hill and as I get
closer to the top.

77
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,990
You know, it gets less steep,

78
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,050
less steep, until all of a sudden, I'm
going down the hill.

79
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,480
And so, at one point, I'm going up.

80
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,860
Later, I'm going down.

81
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,120
Somewhere in the middle, it must have been
flat.

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,220
And so where it's flat, the slope of that
tangent line is going to be equal to zero.

83
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,020
So that means I want to find a point a so
that the derivative,

84
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,440
the derivative is the slope of my tangent
line, is going to be zero.

85
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,000
And I'm going to call

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,139
that point a critical point.

87
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,595
And if my function has a local minimum.
So that means it either has a hump or a

88
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:38,039
trough out of point a, then a is always
going to be a critical point.

89
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,290
And so if I, if I sort of zoom in on my
quadratic utility, so my u of x here is

90
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:53,890
now the quadratic utility function.
I find this point a where it's flat here.

91
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,480
Well, I can also take the derivative of u
of x and

92
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,990
that's this descending line here that I've
called U prime of X.

93
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,350
And where that line crosses 0, that's
where this point is, where the critical

94
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,050
point is going to be.

95
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,330
That's where the tangent line's going to
be flat.

96
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,640
So, where this line is above 0, I have an
upward sloping curve.

97
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,910
When the derivative is less than 0, so
below

98
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,290
the X axis, I have a downward sloping
curve.

99
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,720
And then, you can do exactly the same
thing.

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,580
If it were this is just some arbitrary
function that now has a local minimum.

101
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:38,390
And so now where it's downward sloping I
have a derivative of less than zero.

102
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,170
Where it's upward sloping.
I have a derivative greater than zero,.

103
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,700
And where this derivative actually hits
the x axis,

104
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,480
that's where my critical point is going to
be.

105
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,490
And so the lesson we want to take away
from this is.

106
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,600
If f prime of x is decreasing at a, so
here

107
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,860
f prime of x is going down at the point a.

108
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,720
Then I have a local maximum.

109
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,210
So the funtion looks like the top of a
hill.

110
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,440
If it's increasing, so here, the
derivitive

111
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,330
is increasing when I hit the critical
point.

112
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,530
Then I have a local minimum.

113
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,190
And so most of the time what's going to
happen when you're taking derivatives.

114
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,760
You take a derivative of a function f of x
and

115
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,900
you get f prime of x and that's also a
function.

116
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,669
And most of the time f prime of x is also
going to be a differentiable function.

117
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,980
And so you could again take its
derivative.

118
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,100
And so we're going to denote that by f
double prime of

119
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,510
x, which is just the derivative of f prime
of x.

120
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,420
And f double prime is called the second
derivative of f of x.

121
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,560
And I can also write it in Liebniz
notation, so

122
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,490
Now I take the first derivative of f of x.

123
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,140
I think of this thing in the square
brackets as a function.

124
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,140
And I take that function's derivative one
more time with respect to x.

125
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,290
I can write, this d squared over dx
squared to

126
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,870
mean take the derivative, take the second
derivative in one step.

127
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,870
And I can also use this notation d squared
f over dx squared

128
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,170
to mean the function that is the second
derivative of f of x.

129
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,820
And sometimes you'll also see this so you,
you just use a

130
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,760
capital letter d, so df of x would be the
first derivative of f of x.

131
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:49,270
D squared f of x is the second derivative.
And then there's no reason to stop at two.

132
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,660
So you can have as many higher derivatives
as you want.

133
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,400
some notation that seems to be pretty
common as you have f

134
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,830
to the n but the n is in parentheses.
So that just means the nth derivative of

135
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,060
the function f of x.
just like we had d

136
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,580
squared dx here, we can have d to the n, d
x to the n of f of

137
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,560
x.
Or this capital letter D to the n of x.

138
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,460
But that's only going to work if the one
before that so f n minus

139
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,839
1 of x is a differentiable function.

140
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,430
So as long as the derivative is a
differentiable function itself,

141
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,960
you can then take the derivative again
and, and keep going.

142
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,870
And so if we go back to our local maximum
and local minimum

143
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:47,440
picture, if I plot the first derivative I
get this decreasing line.

144
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,610
If I plot the second derivative, that's
just

145
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,100
going to be the slope of the first
derivative.

146
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,030
But the derivative is already a line, so
its slope is going to be constant.

147
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,900
So I just get a constant value here, u
double prime of x.

148
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,798
And so, f of x equals 0, sorry f prime of
x equals 0, so I have a

149
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:12,440
critical point at a here.
And f double prime of x.

150
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,400
So th, these, I really ought to have put A
in here.

151
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,360
So if I evaluate f double prime at a as
well.

152
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,520
So if I look at a, and go down to f double
prime, that's less than zero.

153
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,510
Then that corresponds to a local maximum.

154
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,520
So allow, that allows me to classify this
critical point as a maximum.

155
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,900
Where if f prime of a were equal to 0, so
here

156
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,780
I have, now I'm talking about the graph on
the right hand side.

157
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,470
I have a critical point, because the
derivative is equal to zero.

158
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,800
But here f of x, f prime of x is upward
sloping.

159
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,120
So f double prime of x is going to be a
positive constant.

160
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,700
So f double prime of a,

161
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,560
in particular, is going to be greater than
0.

162
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,640
And that's going to correspond to a local
minimum.

163
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,840
So these are called first and second order
condition.

164
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,600
The first order condition says the
derivative has to be equal to zero.

165
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,860
Second order condition says second
derivative less than zero.

166
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,450
And that gives me a local minimum.

167
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,520
And then if the second derivative is
greater than zero,

168
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,910
sorry, second derivative less than zero
gives me a local maximum.

169
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,690
Second derivative greater than zero gives
me a local minimmum.

170
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,360
So for functions like this it's not too
bad, you

171
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,590
can just draw a picture and it's usually
pretty clear.

172
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,170
But things get you know can get a little
bit more

173
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:42,630
complicated and then especially if the
function has several critical points.

174
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,649
And you're looking for a maximum, you
might want to wait till we

175
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:46,660
[INAUDIBLE]

176
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,390
the local minimum.

177
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,210
So for a financial example of this suppose
I have a certain

178
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,610
amount of money, and I want to divide it
into two assets.

179
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,960
And my goal is to, so that, that is
something called a portfolio.

180
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,570
And I want to choose how much I'm going to

181
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,960
put into each asset to maximize my
expected return.

182
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,840
And so basically what I want to do is I am

183
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,450
suppose I'm not allowed to short sell
either one of those.

184
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,570
So short sell means to sell something that
I don't actually own.

185
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,920
If I'm not allowed to do that, I have to
put some amount

186
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,300
of money into asset A and some amount of
money into asset B.

187
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,870
And those two amounts have to both be
greater than 0.

188
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,700
And sum up to my total amount of money.

189
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,600
So the way I'm going to simplify that is
just say f

190
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,880
of x is going to be defined on the
interval 01.

191
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,050
And x is just going to be the ratio.

192
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,460
Or the, the fraction of money that goes
into asset 1.

193
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,940
So asset 1 get's x.
Asset 2 get's 1 minus x.

194
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,300
And if I only consider x on the interval

195
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,529
0 1, then both of those are going to be
positive.

196
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,440
more generally, you can do this on an
interval AB,

197
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,640
but 01 will work for what I want to show
off here.

198
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:15,610
So, if I want to find all of the minimum
and maximum values of this function on 01.

199
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,425
The approach I'm going to use is first
find all

200
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:22,720
of the critical points on the open
interval 0 1.

201
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,220
And

202
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,840
I'm just going to evaluate f of x there.

203
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,780
And I also need to evaluate f of x at a
and b.

204
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,330
so a and b are the end points.

205
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,063
So I need to evaluate f of 0 and f of 1.

206
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,900
And then the global maximum.

207
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,660
So I can say what the global maximum is
going to be because I

208
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,920
know all of the points where that could
occur on this interval 0 1.

209
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,380
It's just going to be the maximum of all
the points I find in steps 1 and 2.

210
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,290
And then the minimum is going to be The
minimum

211
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,640
of all the ones I find in steps one and
two.

212
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,890
And really it's step two that I'm trying
to to harp on here because

213
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,890
this is what could happen.

214
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,440
So suppose this little tick over here is
meant to be 1.

215
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,520
If I have an expected return that looks
something like this, I would find Just

216
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,520
by using calculus, maybe these two orange
points, which are the critical points.

217
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,770
And then I would see well this one's
positive, and this one's negative.

218
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,140
And, if I'm investing, I certainly don't
want to invest in something that has

219
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:40,330
a negative expected return, so I would
probably choose this point here.

220
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,610
But it turns out that in this particular
example, the best choice would just be to

221
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:50,700
put all of my money in asset one and none
of my money in asset two.

222
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,930
And so this is actually a pretty common
interview question.

223
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,920
They'll set up some sort of payment off
scheme like this where

224
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,029
if you don't check the end points, you're
going to get the wrong answer.

225
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:07,320
And then another step you can do is
calculate the second derivative of f of x.

226
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,820
And evaluate it at the two critical
points.

227
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,630
And that would allow you classify those as
local minimum or local maximum.
