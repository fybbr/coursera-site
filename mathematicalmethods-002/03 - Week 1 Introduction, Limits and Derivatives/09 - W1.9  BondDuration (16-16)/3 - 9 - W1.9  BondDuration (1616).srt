1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,910
So now I'm going to look at something
called bond duration.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,930
This is just meant to be a little bit more
involved example of taking a derivative.

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,770
So a price of a bond is given by a
following formula.

4
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:29,250
so P oops P is the price of the bond.

5
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,040
And if you look at this it looks a lot

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,320
like what we talked about on tuesday for
present value.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,070
And so what basically the way a bond works
is or

8
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,640
at least the one that I've written down
the formula for.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,890
It has a face value, so let's just pretend
that's $100.

10
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,970
And it has coupon payments, and that's
going to make n coupon payments.

11
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,466
And so the agreement I'm going to enter
into with somebody

12
00:00:57,466 --> 00:01:01,200
is, I sell them the bond.
So they end up with a piece of paper.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,496
I end up with $100.

14
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:07,770
And then every year.

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,314
So this is, this is sort of set up for
yearly coupon payments.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,530
I'm going, let's see, I have the 100
dollars, they have the bond.

17
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,628
I'm gong to pay them the coupon payment.

18
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:22,500
So that might be say, 5 dollars.
So

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,440
I'm borrowing their money, and the price
of doing that

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,590
is that I have to give them 5 dollars
every year.

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,050
And after N payments, I have to give them
5 dollars, plus their money back.

22
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,600
So they get their 100 dollars back.

23
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,680
So, all I'm doing to calculate the price
of my bond.

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,590
So I'm taking the face value, and I'm
discounting that N periods.

25
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,660
And then I'm taking this stream

26
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,980
of coupon payments And I'm cou, I'm
discounting the first coupon payment

27
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,140
for one year; I'm discounting the second
coupon payment for two years.

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,510
Looks like I might have forgotten some
parentheses

29
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,710
around this, but it's better on this side.

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,324
yeah.

31
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,590
And so it's essentially just it's the same
rules

32
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,310
that we had before for doing present value
calculation.

33
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,910
Just applied to this slightly more
complicated payment

34
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,440
scheme of a bond which is what we

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,350
did with the annuity plus you're going to
get the, the face value of the bond back.

36
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:35,920
So c is a coupon payment, n is the number
of periods remaining, f is the face value

37
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,650
and then this value lambda, which is sort
of playing the role of the interest rate

38
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,240
from our last calculations.
For bonds it's called yield to maturity.

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,194
So, I'm going to

40
00:02:52,194 --> 00:02:59,010
make just a small change to that.
And instead of calling

41
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,760
the coupon payments capital C, and having
them all be the same, I'm going to say

42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,810
C sub little k.

43
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,330
And the only real reason I want to do this
is now I can just say that the.

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,030
All of the short term ones.

45
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,570
So, you know, one up to n minus one are

46
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,410
all of, sorry not short term but only
coupon payments one.

47
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,020
Those are all going to be the same c and
then the

48
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,660
last one is just going to be the coupon
plus the face value.

49
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,680
And so that's going to give me my present

50
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,620
value for whatever payment I'm going to
receive in the

51
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:28,780
[UNKNOWN]

52
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,280
period.

53
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,620
So now I can rewrite my, my bond pretty
much using the same formula we had last

54
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,260
time except that instead of having a
constant value, so I think I called

55
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,120
it A last time, I now have something that
can be different every time but for

56
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,550
this particular type of bond it's going to
be the same for N minus one periods.

57
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,910
And then the last one is just going to be
face value plus coupon payment.

58
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,500
And then I have to divide them by

59
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,030
1 plus the yield to maturity to the case
power, because

60
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,260
I need to discount money that I'm going to
receive in the future.

61
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,260
The duration of a bond is a weighted
average Of

62
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,710
the time that these payments are going to
be made.

63
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:25,000
So I'm going to define, the weights as the
present value of the payment received

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,200
in period k, divided by the price, and
then I'm going to multiply that by k.

65
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,040
And so k is just the index here, it's
going from one up to

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,960
n, so this is going to be You know, pv1
divided by p.

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,990
So that's weight 1 times 1.

68
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,240
Pv2 divided by p is going to be weight 2.

69
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,770
So it'll be weight 2 times 2 plus weight 3
times 3 and so on up to n.

70
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:56,040
And when I sum all of those things up, I'm
going to call that D, which is duration.

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,235
And if you think about this, what are the
units of PVK.

72
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:02,935
It's a present value of something, so it's
going to be made in dollars.

73
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:02,935
>>

74
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:03,435
[INAUDIBLE]

75
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,050
present value, of the

76
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,050
[INAUDIBLE]

77
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,457
made in PDK?
>> Yeah.

78
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:11,470
>> Okay.

79
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,454
>> And then P is just the sum of all of
them.

80
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:14,980
>> OKAY.

81
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,812
>> That's the price of the bond today.
>> Yeah.

82
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:25,210
And so, what's going to end up happening

83
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,760
here is, present value is measured in
dollars.

84
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,730
The price of the bond is also measured in
dollars.

85
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,190
So when I do this division, I have
something

86
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,050
measured in dollars divided by something
measured in dollars.

87
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,656
So, I get a unit less quantity.

88
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,810
And, K, this is going to be dates.

89
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,110
So, K is actually, has some sort of units
in time.

90
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,120
So, the way I've written this down, this
is for yearly coupon

91
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:58,350
payment So k is going to be one year, two
years, three years, four years.

92
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,470
So kind of interestingly

93
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,160
this quantity duration is measured in
years.

94
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,630
And I guess that will sort of seem a
little bit more strange

95
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,480
once we see how duration's going to get
used in this bond pricing formula.

96
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,550
And so then another thing I can do is just
take this P

97
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,930
out the denominator here and put it on the
left side of the equation.

98
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,680
And I'm just doing this because this sum
of K times PVK

99
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,380
is going to be something that falls out of
a calculation later.

100
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,780
And I'm going to want to be able to
replace that with duration times price.

101
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,740
Yep.
>> I'm confused

102
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,715
why we're waiting payments further into
the future more heavily.

103
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:48,174
>> the present value of something in the
future is going to be less.

104
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:48,174
>>

105
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:48,178
[CROSSTALK]

106
00:06:48,178 --> 00:06:49,378
Less.
Yeah.

107
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:51,280
>> Yeah.
>> so, is that

108
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,280
[UNKNOWN]

109
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,950
undo that to get the price.
I mean here it's not really clear.

110
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,710
>> Why someone tried to do this in the
first place.

111
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,940
I think, as we go forward you're going to
see that this

112
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,650
sort of pops out as a useful quantity in,
in the equations.

113
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,820
And so I guess yeah, next bullet point.

114
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:20,380
So, sensitivity, Is suppose that this
yield to maturity rate changes.

115
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,550
What's going to happen to the value of the
bond?

116
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,250
So I'm asking said, that's a sensitivity
if, if that rate

117
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,010
changes a little and there's a big change
in the price, we're

118
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,010
going to say that's highly sensitive and
if the rate changes

119
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,600
and the price stays pretty much the same,
then that's low sensitivity.

120
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,020
So the present value of the payment
received in period k, so here

121
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:55,830
Ck is the nominal payment so that's, you
know, the $5 or the $105.

122
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,410
So I, in period n I'm going to get a
hundred and five dollars.

123
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,400
And every other period I'm going to get
five dollars.

124
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,590
And then this number in the bottom is
going to be bigger than one.

125
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,390
So the present value of that's going be
getting smaller.

126
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:17,440
And so I can write that as Ck.
Times 1 plus Lambda to the minus K.

127
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,710
So, I'm basically just taking this out of
the denominator, and writing it like this.

128
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,000
So, I've always been doing this when I
want to take a

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,970
derivative, so I'm just setting myself up
to use the Power Rule here.

130
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,550
So now, if I want to take the derivative
of the present value of the Kth

131
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:39,450
payment, with respect to Lambda Well it
should

132
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,570
be pretty straightforward, the power rule
of linearity.

133
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,260
And then you have to be a bit careful
because the chain rule

134
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,660
comes into play here too because I
actually have a function of a function.

135
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,130
But luckily the derivative of this inside
function is one.

136
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,200
So that's a time where you can forget the
chain rule and

137
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,600
still get the right answer.
not a very safe habit.

138
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,080
So this just becomes minus k times C sub
k,

139
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,130
my argument here and then minus k minus 1.

140
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,720
So that's just a, the power rule to take
the derivative.

141
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,220
And

142
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,660
then I can rewrite it like this.

143
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,760
So that's sort of just undoing this
negative exponent trick.

144
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,910
And minus k minus 1 is the same as the
quantity k plus 1 times negative 1.

145
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,110
So that's why we get a power of k plus 1
down here.

146
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:42,100
And now if you look carefully at this, we
have C sub k divided

147
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,870
by one plus lambda to the k.
But that was just Where is it?

148
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,850
Right here.

149
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,799
Our definition of PVK.

150
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,600
And then I have this plus 1 down here,
which

151
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,730
gives me 1 extra 1 plus lambda in the
denominator.

152
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,430
And I have a minus k in

153
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,980
the numerator.

154
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,100
So I end up with minus k over 1

155
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,530
plus lambda times the present value of the
kth payment.

156
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,709
And now let's look at, the price.

157
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,200
So my goal was to figure out what's the

158
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,690
sensity of sensitivity of the price not
just each payment.

159
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,650
So if I want to take the derivative of
that with

160
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,020
respect to lambda I'm going to take the
derivative so

161
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,060
my definition for the price was just the

162
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,659
present value of this future stream of
payments.

163
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,570
And by my linearity property of
derivatives,

164
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,060
I can move this derivative inside the sum.

165
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,020
So, the derivative of a sum is the sum of
the derivatives.

166
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,010
And we've already computed this.

167
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,320
This is what I just did on the last slide,
the derivative

168
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,090
of the present value of decay of payment
divided with respect to lambda.

169
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,010
And so I'm just going to plug my formula
from the previous slide in here.

170
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,460
And I get this guy.

171
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:01,960
And

172
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,990
now if you look at that, remember what did
we say duration was?

173
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,190
Duration was k times pvk Summed up.

174
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,910
So what I'm going to do is take the
negative one

175
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,330
and the divided one plus lambda out in
front of the sum.

176
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,740
And then I'm left with just the sum of k
times pvk

177
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,480
which is this quanitty duration.

178
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,590
That just sort of falls out of us taking
the derivative.

179
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,910
And this, this quantity here, so negative
1 divided

180
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,890
1 plus Lambda times the duration, is
called, oops.

181
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,230
Not the negative, everything but the
negative.

182
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,140
There.

183
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,809
Is called Modified Duration.

184
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,460
And so the sensitivity, the rate of change
of the price, with

185
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,650
respect to the, you can think of this as
the interest rate.

186
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,540
Is equal to minus the modified duration
times the price.

187
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,770
M'kay, yeah, so dm is modified duration.

188
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,510
And so, this is what we've found now.

189
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,210
That the derivative of the price which
repsect to the yield

190
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:26,370
to maturity, is the negative of the
modified duration times the price.

191
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,610
And I'm going to make one more Little
substitution here, so since the price

192
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,070
it's obviously going to be non zero, I can
divide both sides by price.

193
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,890
And now I have the change in price, with
respect to

194
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,060
a change in the yield to maturity, divided
by the price.

195
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,050
So the change in price, That's going to be
something that's measured in dollars.

196
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,850
So if the price changes from $100 down to
$180, The change

197
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,649
in price was negative $20.

198
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,360
If I divide that by the price, now I have
some sort of rate.

199
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,420
So, it doesn't matter what the price was.

200
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,150
If it, if it went from 100 down to 80 or
if it went

201
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:13,690
from 1,000 down to 800, this thing on the
left is going to be the same.

202
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,880
And so, that's going to be our
interpretation.

203
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,240
For the

204
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,580
modified duration.

205
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,880
So it's going to give us some measure of
the relative

206
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,390
change in price as the yield to maturity
is changing.

207
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,979
And kind of in summary, duration then
which is something measured in years.

208
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,888
Is a measure of interest rate sensitivity.

209
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:41,380
Yes?
>>

210
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,380
[INAUDIBLE]

211
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:49,700
sensitivity will price things, will price
change

212
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:49,725
[INAUDIBLE].

213
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:53,753
>> You mean like that?
>> Yeah.

214
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:54,711
>> Okay.

215
00:13:54,711 --> 00:14:01,410
>> the other question is.
>> M'kay, and so

216
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,500
essentially all we've, we've done here is,
we've just figured out what this

217
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:13,127
curve.
So this is that curve in the price-yield

218
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:13,160
[UNKNOWN]

219
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,632
space, so it's called a "price-yield

220
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:17,560
curve." And I've calculated the
derivitives,

221
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,800
so it's just going to be the slope of this
tangent line.

222
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,260
And so then, one of the, one of the main
things

223
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,880
you're going to use a derivative for, when
you can find a

224
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,790
tangent line like this is if you, if you
look at

225
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:34,030
this, maybe between about eight percent
and maybe twelve or thirteen percent.

226
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,990
This tangent line is very, very close to
the actual curve,

227
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,130
and it's going to be easy to evaluate
points along

228
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,720
the tangent line because it's just a
linear function.

229
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,620
It actually can be quite difficult

230
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,310
especially, you know, when people were
trying

231
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,150
to do these computations before you had

232
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,570
computers, to evaluate points along this
curve.

233
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,020
So one of the ideas of doing this, this
approximation and finding the tangent line

234
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,010
is it gives us a good way to make local
approximations to our function value.

235
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:14,110
And you can actually improve this so.

236
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,630
What we've done here, is just the first
order of approximation.

237
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,970
What we're trying to approximate this
function

238
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,850
with a linera function so a tangenr line.

239
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,360
You can use convexity, which is sort of
how quickly

240
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,450
the second derivative so the size of the
second derivative.

241
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,920
It's sort of how quickly this curve is
changing slope.

242
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,880
And that allows us to make an even better
approximation.

243
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,370
And we'll, we'll come to that, in the, the
second half of this course.

244
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,430
So after the midterm.

245
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,990
Okay.
So just a quick summary.

246
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,930
This is a formula for duration.

247
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,130
You can also multiply the price on the
left hand side and get this k times PVk.

248
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,260
Modified duration is just one divided by
one plus lambda times duration.

249
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:06,400
And then the price sensitivity formula is,
so

250
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,500
the, the rate of change of the price with
respect to a change in in interest rate.

251
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,540
Is minus the modified duration times the
price.

252
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:14,540
