1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,080
So now I want to start talking about
something called the limit.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,020
So in the, in the previous section we, we
came up with this

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:15,820
formula for, for a perpetuity which I'm
receiving an infinite stream of payments.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,100
But that has a, a finite value, so you
know

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,310
that, value of this thing it's approaching
something called a limit.

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,620
but I want to sort of give you another

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,630
example where that's not going to work to
motivate

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,710
why we need to have a rigorous
mathematical definition

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,770
for what's going on here for, for our
limit.

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,430
So suppose, instead you know, I receive a
dollar in year one,

11
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,643
I pay a dollar in year two, receive a
dollar in year three and so on.

12
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:50,140
And I want to say what's the, what's the

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,270
present value of this sort of future
stream of payments.

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,290
So that's, that's kind of trying to couch
it

15
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,140
in the same terms I was using before, but
let's

16
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,493
just think of this as calculating the sum
of

17
00:01:01,493 --> 00:01:05,060
one minus one plus one minus one, and so
on.

18
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,080
And so one way you could approach this is,
you could just draw parentheses around

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,740
every one minus one, and there would still
be an infinite number of these groups.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,130
So I'm going to have plus one minus one.

21
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,897
So each one of these quantities is
going to be zero.

22
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,930
so then I'm just summing from k equals one
to infinity, the number zero.

23
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,760
And so, hopefully that would be equal to

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,770
zero but I, I've put, question marks about
some

25
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,830
of these equality signs because I want to

26
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,953
say that doing this might be kind of
dubious.

27
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,540
So if I could re-write it this way, then I
could.

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,900
So, this way I mean that.

29
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,090
So if I re-write it as plus one, minus one
as a quantity and then take the

30
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,580
sum of that.
If I could use the, the normal rules for

31
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,810
addition I could just split this sum up as
an infinite sum of positive ones

32
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:12,650
and an infinite sum of negative ones, and
rewrite it like this.

33
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,940
And so then again, you would think that,
you know, if you agree that this thing

34
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,310
up here is equal to zero, you should

35
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,620
probably agree that this here is equal to
zero.

36
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,120
But

37
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,530
now I can do something a bit tricky, so I
want to

38
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,600
use this same idea of you know, sort of
popping a few

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,980
terms off of my sum that I used last time
to, to

40
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,010
figure out what the value of an annuity or
a perpetuity is.

41
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,470
So in if I write this infinite sum of ones

42
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,070
well I'm just going to pop off the first
three say.

43
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,790
So I have one plus one plus one.

44
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,150
Plus the sum from k equals four to
infinity of one.

45
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,200
But it doesn't really matter what I use as
my index here.

46
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,970
It's just an infinite stream of ones.
So I'm going to replace this k with j.

47
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,890
But it's just going to be, you know, it's
a different name for the same thing.

48
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,520
It's a different index but it's just
going to start at one again.

49
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,205
So I have one plus one plus one and an
infinite stream of ones.

50
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,120
And so if I plug that in, I'm just trying
to

51
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,080
do the same trick that I did last time, of
subtraction.

52
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,300
So, I'll plug that in for the first one,
so my sum of positive ones

53
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,730
becomes this guy here and then I still
have my infinite stream of negative ones.

54
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,078
And now I have my sum of positive ones
minus

55
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:42,080
oops, sum of positive ones minus my sum of
negative ones.

56
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,250
So that should be zero but I've got these
three extra ones sticking out in front.

57
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,430
So now I get the value of this thing is
equal to three.

58
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,480
And so by using this trick I can make it
equal to anything I want to.

59
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,530
So you're not going to be able to do any
sort of arithmetic trick like I did last

60
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,050
time that's going to help you out trying
to

61
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,420
figure out what this thing is equal to
here.

62
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,680
Oops,

63
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:07,680
[INAUDIBLE]

64
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,260
, there we go.

65
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,390
So like I said I can make v equal to any

66
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,810
integer value by just choosing how many
ones I want to pop

67
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,290
off or if I want to to be negative I just
pop

68
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,270
off some of the negative ones from, from
this part right here.

69
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,320
And so, we want to try and think a little
bit about

70
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,345
[UNKNOWN]

71
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:28,390
what's different.

72
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,920
So, if we go back my, my formula for

73
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,490
the annuity or for the perpetuity, you
know, those

74
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,850
are in all sorts of investment science
textbooks, Econ

75
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,550
101 textbooks, so clearly they're probably
the right thing.

76
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,100
so what's different about that, then what
I've done here, when I've used exactly

77
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,930
the same trick to try and figure out what
this stream is equal to.

78
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,480
So first I'm going to start out with a
little

79
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,880
bit of notation.

80
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,030
So this is the notation that gets used

81
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,670
in the the textbook we Dan's Definica
textbook.

82
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:06,140
So, oops, r here is, set to real numbers.
So, real numbers

83
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,990
are just every single number that you can
write down using a decimal expansion.

84
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,780
This z with a funny little, type setting
is the set of integers.

85
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,998
So that's just whole numbers, but also
zero and, and negative numbers.

86
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,560
This symbol means in, so when I, when I
talk about

87
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,880
the real numbers and the integers, I'm
thinking of them as sets.

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,920
And a set is kind of a special
construction with one operation.

89
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,040
So something can be either in a set or not
in a set.

90
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,760
And that's all there is to sets.

91
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,580
And so this is the symbol I'm going to use
to say something is in a set.

92
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:49,580
[COUGH]

93
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,080
.

94
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,520
This upside down a is for all.
So if I want to say, you know, this result

95
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,630
holds for all combinations of the inputs.
This is the symbol I'm going to use.

96
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,160
backwards e means there exists

97
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,720
and arrow means goes to.

98
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,320
So, here we, we see the arrow.

99
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,870
This notation means a function g that
takes an argument that's a real number

100
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:33,160
and gives you an answer that's also a real
number, so g takes r to r.

101
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,819
So the, the notation here are these things
on the left and right of the x.

102
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,520
And they mean the floor.
So we think of x as a real number.

103
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,090
And then the floor is just going to be the

104
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,140
largest integer that's less than or equal
to x.

105
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,850
You know if x was three point five, then

106
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,150
the floor of three point five would just
be three.

107
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,780
And then you know hopefully this should be
pretty self explanatory after that.

108
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,610
If I turn these guys around we get
something called the ceiling so

109
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,940
that's just going to be the smallest
integer that's greater than or equal to x.

110
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,200
So again if I had three point three, the

111
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,130
ceiling of three point five is going to be
four.

112
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,630
And

113
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,280
then if I use this slash that's just
going to be not.

114
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,430
So if I wanted to say that x is not

115
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,750
in the set of intergers I would just write
this here.

116
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,310
So the z is the set of integers, the

117
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,220
kind of funny looking epsilon thing means
in, the

118
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,670
slash through it means not in and then x

119
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,680
is the number that I'm making a statement
about.

120
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,900
So x could be three point five, three
point five is not in the integers.

121
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:56,390
Okay, so for our definition of a limit, so
g is a function

122
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:01,390
that takes a real number and gives me a
real value to answer.

123
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,980
And that this notation just means that the
input can be

124
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,770
any real number, and the output is also a
real number.

125
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,860
It doesn't mean that I can get every real
number as an output of that function.

126
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,860
So even if I took, my function being x
squared, I'm not going to be able to get a

127
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,640
negative numbers out of that.

128
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,640
But its still every real number can go in
and

129
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,440
every number that comes out is also a real
number.

130
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,450
So that's what I'm giving up with this
notation here.

131
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,130
Okay.

132
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,670
So this is the definition of a limit from
from the textbook.

133
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,039
So the limit of g of x.

134
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,140
As x goes to x zero so when I say x goes

135
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,140
to x zero I'm thinking of x zero as one
particular point

136
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,530
and then I'm thinking of x as another as a
variable

137
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,170
and I'm moving that variable closer and
closer to this fixed point x zero.

138
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,530
So the limit of g of x as x goes to x zero
exists and

139
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:05,900
is finite and equal to, that's a l, kind
of in my strange projector font.

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,910
So it's equal to l if and only if for any
epsilon greater than zero, so

141
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,300
you generally in mathematics, when you use
the

142
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,420
letter epsilon you're talking about a very
small number.

143
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,400
But I want to say for any epsilon greater
than zero, but think of

144
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,670
this as small, there exists a delta also
greater than zero

145
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,605
so that the absolute difference between
the function value at x

146
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:37,840
and this limit, is less than epsilon, so
this is just

147
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,030
saying I can make my function very close
to this limit.

148
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,110
For

149
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,290
every value of x that's going to fall in
this

150
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,550
interval, x not minus delta, and x not
plus delta.

151
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,616
So that means there's a point, x not,

152
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:59,240
there' s a little interval around that x
not.

153
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,950
And for every x in that interval, my
function, is going to be

154
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:11,635
within epsilon of the limit value.
And so basically,

155
00:10:11,635 --> 00:10:15,600
what, if I can find for any given epsilon,
so really what I want

156
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,880
to able to do, is find this number delta
as a function of epsilon.

157
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,250
And if I can say, then, for any epsilon
greater than zero, I can tell you the

158
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,010
delta, that makes the function, you know,
arbitrarily

159
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,590
close to the limit when it's within this
interval.

160
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,240
Then we're going to say that that value,
l, is

161
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,800
the limit of the function as I go to this

162
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,900
point x zero.

163
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,600
And then here is exactly the same
definition, sort of using all

164
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,410
of the short hand that, that shows up in
the text book.

165
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,940
So we have the limit.

166
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:58,380
So this lim is the abbreviation for limit
as x goes to x zero of g of x

167
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:05,630
equals l, this iff means if and only if,
so it's just an abbreviation for, oops,

168
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,686
this thing up here.
If and only if, for, so a,

169
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:15,820
upside-down a, for all, if and only if,
for epsilon

170
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,000
greater than zero, there exists a delta
greater than

171
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,100
zero, st is such that, and the

172
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:32,170
distance between g of x and l is

173
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:39,499
less than epsilon for all x that's

174
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:45,623
within delta

175
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:49,840
of x zero.
And then

176
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,900
similarly we're going to say, so here
we're talking about limits in

177
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,970
the first definition that are finite so
that means they go

178
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,410
to something else than infinity.

179
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,198
You know, if the limit is 100 the limit is
one, something like that.

180
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:06,320
There's some thing like if I say, what's
the limit of x as

181
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,080
x goes to infinity, obviously that's just
going to keep getting bigger and bigger.

182
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,644
So we also want to have a limit, a
definition,

183
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:17,519
for what we mean if, if a limit diverges.

184
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,290
So I'm going to set the limit as x goes to
x zero of g of x

185
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,670
is infinite if and only if, and now we're
just going to kind of flip this around.

186
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,600
So what I, what I was trying to say for
the first definition of

187
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,180
a limit, for when it's getting close to
something finite, is I want to get.

188
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,640
You know, within a certain neighborhood,
so that when

189
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,820
I'm in that neighborhood I'm within
epsolon of my limit.

190
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,470
I'm just going to flip that around and say
now

191
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,910
there has to be some c greater than zero.

192
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,650
And now

193
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,000
this c is supposed to be a really, really
big number.

194
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,270
Then I'm going to say there exists some
delta greater than zero.

195
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,150
Such that g of x is greater than c.

196
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,330
So c is a big number.

197
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,540
You know, any big number, so as big as you
want.

198
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,778
And I'm going to say now there's some
neighbourhood around x zero.

199
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:17,227
So a neighbourhood, so it's x zero minus
delta to x zero plus delta.

200
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,560
And if I'm in that neighbourhood, every
single point in that neighbourhood when

201
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,040
I evaluate g of x, I'm going to get a
number bigger than c.

202
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,130
And, what's going to happen is suppose I
find a c and I find a delta and now I say,

203
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,626
no I want it bigger, so I just take an
even bigger value for c, so say two c.

204
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:38,590
And my neighbourhood's going to get a
little bit smaller.

205
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,020
But there's still going to be a
neighbourhood that gives me values

206
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,800
greater than c.

207
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,508
And if I can find a function that has that
property, then I'm going to say that

208
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:54,410
g of x, the limit of g of x as x goes to x
zero, is infinite.

209
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,010
That means I can make g of x bigger than
any real number

210
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,516
that you choose just by choosing a value
close enough to x zero.

211
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:09,220
And this is, oops, this is exactly the
same statement but with some of the

212
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,260
things turned around, so now we have for
all

213
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,670
c less than zero and it's going to
negative infinity.

214
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,625
It's exactly the same thing I can now make
my function

215
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,430
value smaller than any real number, so you
give me any

216
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,300
real number, and I tell you, you choose a
neighbourhood of

217
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,440
this width and it will be less than that
real number.

218
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,290
If I can do that then we're going to say
that the limit as x goes to x zero of

219
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,190
g of x is equal to minus infinity.

220
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,490
And so the, this notation also tends to
give

221
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,480
some people trouble when you say exists,
and is finite.

222
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,220
So exists means you get something, well,
okay.

223
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,560
It's kind of circular, but that exists.

224
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,810
So infinity and minus infinity, these
still count as exists.

225
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:00,070
If you have something, and it tends to
show up more when you have a fraction.

226
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,946
But if you have something that's going to

227
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:05,830
zero divided by zero, or infinity divided
by infinity.

228
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,610
Those are things that don't exist.

229
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,520
So, that's the difference why you need to
say exists and is finite.

230
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,730
Most of the time, when people say exists,
they also mean it's finite.

231
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,730
So it's just something to be aware of if
you're

232
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,570
reading, reading a paper, and it doesn't
really make sense.

233
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,760
the exists probably also means

234
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,800
the limit is finite.

235
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,000
And then we also need to be able to

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,220
make sense of limits when x is going to
infinity.

237
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,050
So this is kind of what we had to do with
with calculating the perpetuity.

238
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,700
We wanted to say as n is getting bigger
and bigger,

239
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,610
you know, I can't say as x is going to x
not.

240
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,635
When, because I can't make this

241
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:52,679
neighbourhood of with delta around
infinity.

242
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,180
So we have to

243
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,480
have a slightly different definition for
this.

244
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,730
And basically, the way I'm going to, I'm
going to define this.

245
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:05,920
So the limit of g of x as x goes to
infinity is equal to l.

246
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,330
If and only if, for every epsilon greater
than zero,

247
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,570
there exists some number b.

248
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,720
So this is the same condition on sort of
the range of my function.

249
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,380
You know, the, the value of my function
has to be within epsilon of l.

250
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:28,930
And that's going to hold for every x
greater than b.

251
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,280
So basically what I'm going to do is just
keep

252
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,090
looking at bigger and bigger and bigger
numbers b.

253
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,370
Until I finally get to a number b where I
can say,

254
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:43,620
for every number greater than b, this
condition here is going to be true.

255
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:49,020
If I can do that, then I say that this
limit exists and is equal to l.

256
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,870
And so, we can use our pricing formula as

257
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,559
a little exercise to see how this is
going to work.

258
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:04,830
So we had for an annuity that had a fixed
number of payments.

259
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,215
We had a pricing formula I'm going to call
it v sub n.

260
00:17:08,215 --> 00:17:10,556
So it's a value of annuity based on n
payments.

261
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:14,560
And we're just looking at what happens to
this as n gets bigger and bigger.

262
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:20,090
And kind of intuitively, you should think
that, well

263
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,110
if I just look at the, the limit as

264
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,350
n goes to infinity, we probably should get

265
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,390
the same thing, that we got for the
perpetuity.

266
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,430
And so that's the question I'm going to
try and answer.

267
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,950
And so the way I'm going to set this

268
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,170
up, is I want to say, for some number,
epsilon.

269
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,820
So this is the way you start out every one
of these arguments.

270
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,160
You say given epsilon greater than zero.

271
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,820
That'll be worth one point on the homework
assignment.

272
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,000
Find N such that the difference between
the

273
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,990
annuity and the perpetuity is less than
epsilon.

274
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,650
Whenever little n is

275
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,540
bigger than this value big n.

276
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,880
So what I want to do is find a value big n
say

277
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:10,586
its 1,000 then I know that if you know
little n is 1,001,

278
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:14,400
1,002, 1,003 this v sub n minus v is going
to be

279
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,850
the absolute value of that difference is
going to be less than epsilon.

280
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,320
So I just start out by writing down the
difference.

281
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,270
And so v sub n Is given by, I can't

282
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,570
highlight this whole thing I guess, well
the first term here.

283
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,500
And then the v is just the, the minus a
over r here.

284
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,980
And then if you look at this, you're
going to see that

285
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,280
you have a over r times one minus a over
r.

286
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,720
Or so, I guess I, I did the math here.

287
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,580
And you end up with just this thing in the
middle.

288
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,690
But we're taking the absolute value of
that

289
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,610
so the minus sign is going to go away.

290
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,350
And so this is an expression for the
absolute value

291
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,090
of the difference between my annuity
formula and my perpetuity formula.

292
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,120
And now what I want to do is solve for a
big N.

293
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,050
And this big N has

294
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,580
to be an integer that has the property
that,

295
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,480
for any little n greater than that big N.

296
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,060
This condition holds, and basically the
only reason I'm dividing epsilon

297
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,630
by two is I need to have it strictly less
than epsilon.

298
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,930
And so the easiest way to do that is to
say, if I can make

299
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,670
it less than or equal to epsilon over

300
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,950
two, epsilon over two is certainly
strictly less.

301
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,520
Then epsilon, so that's just going to get
my definition you

302
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,980
know, without having to worry about these
kind of corner cases.

303
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,020
So now it just becomes an algebra
exercise, you know, I'm looking for n here

304
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,640
so I'll just move the a and the r over to
the right hand side.

305
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,150
Then I'm going to take the logarithm of
each side.

306
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,150
And we have this property of the logarithm
that the

307
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,140
log of something to a power is oops, that
power.

308
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,160
So in this case, n times the logarithm of
the base.

309
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,050
And then divide through by one plus r.

310
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,400
And then you have to be a little bit
careful here because, on

311
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,170
the left hand side, this n, I want that to
be an integer.

312
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,030
But on the right hand side, I think you're
going to be hard pressed to

313
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,790
find values of a, epsilon and r, that are
going to make this an integer.

314
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,080
and it needs to be true in general
anyways.

315
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,850
So, this is why we're going to use our
ceiling operator.

316
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,260
So I'm going to

317
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,620
choose my capital N.

318
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,220
Just to be the, the next biggest integer
after this things that we found here.

319
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,320
And then for any n greater than capital N.

320
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:56,340
Well I've chosen this n so that this thing
holds.

321
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,930
Oops, the middle part holds.

322
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,190
this less than or equals to I guess I was
just

323
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,000
being a little sloppy when I made this
slide, that's actually equality.

324
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,350
We've shown, you know, that the only way
that we could have the equality here is

325
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,110
on the off chance that I did pick a, r and
epsilon, so, this exactly an integer.

326
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,670
so I've used epsilon over two here to
solve for n.

327
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,950
And that's going to be strictly less than
epsilon, so I'm able to show

328
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:32,768
that regardless of what value of epsilon
you tell me, I can tell you a value

329
00:21:32,768 --> 00:21:35,460
of n that's going to make my annuity

330
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,380
formula and my perpetuity formula less
than epsilon apart.

331
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,870
And so in that case, we're going to say
that the

332
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,700
limit of the annuity formula as n goes to
infinity

333
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,292
is equal to capital N, or sorry, is equal

334
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:53,730
to the perpetuity formula, is equal to
capital V.

335
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,610
Okay, so summary for our limits, thing.
Our limits section.

336
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:08,310
So, given epsilon greater than zero, we
can find we can find

337
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:14,000
capital N such that this difference is
always, the absolute value

338
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,690
of this difference is always less than
epsilon for any epsilon that you tell me.

339
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,860
So that way I can say, that the limit of V
sub n as n goes to

340
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,540
infinite, is equal to V.

341
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:32,310
And then, again, this is, our definition
of the limit, so the limit as x

342
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:36,410
goes to x zero of g of x is equal to l if
and only if.

343
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:42,380
For every epsilon greater than zero, there
exists a delta greater than zero, such

344
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,270
that the absolute value of the difference
of g of x and the, the limit

345
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,570
is less than or, is less than epsilon
whenever x is within delta of x zero.
