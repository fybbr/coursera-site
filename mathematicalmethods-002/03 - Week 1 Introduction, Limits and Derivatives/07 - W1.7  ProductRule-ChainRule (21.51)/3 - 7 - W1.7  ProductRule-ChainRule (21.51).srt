1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,060
So now onto some more complicated rules
for taking derivatives.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,810
So the first one is going to be the
product rule.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,860
So suppose f of x and g of x are
differentiable functions.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,110
So this is going to be kind of like my
linearity rule from from the last section.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,488
So I'm not going to be given f of x and g
of x, I'm going to be given a function but

6
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:28,472
as I look at it, I'm going to see that

7
00:00:28,472 --> 00:00:33,110
that function is actually composed of two
simpler functions multiplied together.

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,880
And if I can take the derivative of each
of those simpler funtions,

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,040
then the product rule is going to allow me
to

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,120
take the derivative of the product of
those two functions.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,115
So, suppose I'm given a function p of x,
and I can see a way to write it down as a

12
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:53,854
function of f of x times the function g of

13
00:00:53,854 --> 00:00:57,015
x, and I want to take the derivative of p
of x.

14
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:02,867
So p of x is differentiable and the

15
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:09,402
derivative of p of x, or p prime of x.

16
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,979
Ops, so my definition

17
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,959
of p of x is just the product of f of x
and g of x and the product rule says that

18
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:21,188
the derivative of this is going to be the
derivative of the first function,

19
00:01:21,188 --> 00:01:26,262
so f prime of x.
Times g of x, times g of x

20
00:01:26,262 --> 00:01:31,392
plus the first function, so f of x, times
the

21
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:36,387
derivative of the second function, g prime

22
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,130
of x.

23
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,050
And so I think the, the best way to

24
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,669
deal with this is just to go through some
examples.

25
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,610
Ops.

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,083
So, in several of my slides I start out
the slide with a recall just to remind

27
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,284
you what the product rule is, so this

28
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:54,250
is just the definition of the product rule
here.

29
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,279
And suppose my function, p of x, is x
times e to the x.

30
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,961
So, right away, I'm going to recognize
this this is

31
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:12,810
the product of a function f of x equals x.

32
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,530
And another function, g of x equals e to
the x.

33
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,660
And I know how to take the derivative of
both of those functions.

34
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,160
So.

35
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,239
I'm going to kind of skip in this course

36
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,960
all of the rules for taking derivatives of
functions.

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,740
These are easy things to look up now, I
actually brought my phone

38
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,250
here, because I found out that Siri, which
is the voice assistant on an Iphone.

39
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,290
One of the things that it asks for sources
of data

40
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,030
is Wolfram Alpha, which is this website
I've been recommending to you.

41
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,484
So I'm going to try an onscreen
demonstration of this, see what happens.

42
00:02:50,484 --> 00:02:55,480
what's the derivative of the exponential
function?

43
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,507
>> Checking on that.
Here's what I found.

44
00:03:02,507 --> 00:03:02,730
>> Okay.

45
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,960
So I don't know if the camera is going to
be able to pick that up.

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,600
But it shows up this little, I don't know
what that's suppose to be.

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,498
Actually that's a dot matrix printer paper
but it

48
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:18,249
actually has the derivative of the
exponential function on it.

49
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:25,174
although they used a capital X and I used
a small x but otherwise

50
00:03:25,174 --> 00:03:28,390
it's exactly what I wanted.

51
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,740
So the point is and I'm going to remember
to switch off the ring

52
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,163
[INAUDIBLE]

53
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:35,650
otherwise I will get embarrassed.
you can use a lot of tools.

54
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,502
Google would probably find the correct
answer for this

55
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:44,355
If you have a computer algebra program
like Mathematica or

56
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:48,540
Maple, you're going to be able to ask it
questions like that.

57
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,820
You can look this up in any number of
calculus text books.

58
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,844
So kind of going through all of these
rules I'm going to skip

59
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:57,679
that but when you come to a function you
don't know how

60
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:01,585
to take the derivative of there're lots of
tools available online or

61
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:04,830
in the library that will help you figure
out how to do that.

62
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,054
So what we just found

63
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:09,366
out from Wolfram Alpha via Siri was that
the derivative

64
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:12,040
of this function e to the x is just
itself.

65
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,279
So it's a it's a special function that has
the property that it's own derivative.

66
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,280
So this one, will be the easy one to take
the derivative of.

67
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,470
And, this is isn't going to be too hard
either.

68
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,940
You can think of x as just x to the one.

69
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,320
And use the power rule.

70
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,020
So you get one times x to the one minus
one, or one.

71
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,980
So I'm going to break this up as f of x
equals x.

72
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,260
G of x equals e to the x.

73
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,500
And then just, evaluate this.

74
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,190
So what I end up is derivative of x is one
times e to the x.

75
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,260
Plus derivative of e to the x, which is
itself, times x.

76
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,474
And then, I'm just going to Do a little
bit

77
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:02,950
of grouping like this, because I think it
looks nicer.

78
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,080
But either this or this line.

79
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,780
These would both be acceptable answers
for, for the derivative.

80
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,730
So, for my second example, I defined p of
t.

81
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,040
So here, there's no real difference
between using x and t.

82
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,364
It's just the variable.
I can call it anything I want to.

83
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:29,090
a lot of times, t shows up as kind of a
variable name for time.

84
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,790
X shows up for position, You know?

85
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,363
S shows up for an asset price.

86
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:38,423
it doesn't matter you do everything
exactly the same,

87
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:41,730
regardless of how you choose to label the
parts of your function.

88
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:50,890
And so p of t is defined to be the square
root of t times the quantity 1 minus t.

89
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,126
And so I'm going to look at this, and I'm
going to say,

90
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:55,362
well that, if I want that to be a product,
the, the

91
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:59,816
simplest thing Is going to be the square
root of t,

92
00:05:59,816 --> 00:06:02,780
as f of x, and one minus t as g of x.

93
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,300
And then to make taking the square root
possible, I

94
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,230
can rewrite that as t to the one half
power.

95
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,550
And so this is just another way to express
roots.

96
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,134
So if I wanted the cube root of t, that
would be

97
00:06:18,134 --> 00:06:22,324
t to the 1 3rd power and so on and it's a

98
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:25,996
lot easier I think to take the derivative
when it's written like

99
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:29,480
this, it's just very clear that you can
use the power rule.

100
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,632
So now that I've defined my f of t and g
of t I'm

101
00:06:34,632 --> 00:06:40,530
just going to take the derivatives and
then plug the, plug the pieces into the.

102
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,160
Product rule.

103
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:48,236
So the derivative of t to the one half
that's by the power rule

104
00:06:48,236 --> 00:06:52,440
just going to be one half times t to the
one half minus 1.

105
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,060
So one half times t to the negative one
half then times g of t.

106
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,790
So times the quantity 1 minus t.

107
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,950
Plus t to the one half, so that my f of t.

108
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,770
And then the derivative of 1 minus t, we
have to

109
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,422
sort of, in our head, use the linear ity

110
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:15,290
principal and the power rule at the same
time.

111
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,214
So this says that I can take the
derivative of g of t,

112
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:22,340
it's going to be the derivative of 1,
which is a constant so it's zero.

113
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,150
And the derivative of minus t, which is
just going to be negative 1.

114
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:33,330
So that's where this minus 1 comes from.
It's a derivative of minus t.

115
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,902
And then I can

116
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:36,292
do a little bit of simplification.

117
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:42,326
replace the t to the one half with a
square root of t, if you want to.

118
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:47,910
And maybe mess around with it a little bit
to make it a bit more pretty.

119
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,650
But again, you know, once you are

120
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,530
this far, you've successfully taken the
derivative,

121
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,960
and the rest of this is just to make it a
little bit more presentable.

122
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,340
The next rule I want to talk about is
called the chain rule.

123
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,560
This is probably the most important rule,
and where you will make the most mistakes.

124
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,466
So again, we're going to talk about two
differentiable

125
00:08:12,466 --> 00:08:15,054
functions, f of x and g of x.

126
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:19,110
And so last time we we thought about
multiplying them together.

127
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,990
This time we're going to think about
evaluating, how did I do this,

128
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,773
so f of x.
Taking the result of that and feeding

129
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:34,870
it into g of x.
And so that's called a composite function.

130
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,664
The text book uses this notation, all it

131
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:44,881
means is so g composed with f of x is,
sorry,

132
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:49,993
g evaluated.
At f of x, I find it a lot more sensible

133
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:53,592
just to always write it down like this.
Any time I've

134
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:57,176
tried to write it down like this, I end up
confusing myself, so I prefer this

135
00:08:57,176 --> 00:09:01,422
notation.
So if f of x and g of x are differentiable

136
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:08,552
functions, then the composite function g
of f of x is also differentiable

137
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:15,337
and the derivative of this composite
function is the derivative of the

138
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:17,420
outside function.

139
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,499
So the derivative of g of x evaluated at f
of x times f prime of x.

140
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,910
And, so like I said, I really don't like
this notation of the composite fuction.

141
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,740
I, I tend to confuse myself.

142
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,016
So, another way you can write this is
using

143
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:43,567
something called Leibniz Notation, who is
just another mathematician

144
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:48,770
and so what you do is you think of you
think of it in sort of two steps.

145
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:53,390
So first I'm going to evaluate f of x and
that's going to give me a number u.

146
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,121
And then I'm going to evaluate g at that
number

147
00:09:58,121 --> 00:10:00,849
u to get my final answer, g of f of x.

148
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,154
And the chain rule then says that the
derivative of

149
00:10:06,154 --> 00:10:10,846
g, so the derivative of the outside
function, with respect

150
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:14,710
to x which is the argument of the inside
function,

151
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,310
is the derivative of just g with respect
to it's argument,

152
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,469
times the derivative of u.

153
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:27,123
So the argument for the outside function
with respect to x.

154
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:30,396
And I think this will become clear once I
start doing some examples.

155
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:35,108
So like I said this is called Leibniz
notation.

156
00:10:35,108 --> 00:10:42,400
So first I'll try to do a few using using
this funny Composite function notation.

157
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,524
So if I say g of f of x is equal to the
square root of x squared plus 1 then I

158
00:10:51,524 --> 00:10:57,840
sort of have to look at that and say that
this has to somehow be two functions.

159
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,170
So the two functions I see.

160
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,550
Are x squared plus 1, and then the square
root.

161
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,775
And again, just to make this a little bit
simpler, I'm

162
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:14,600
going to write the square root as this
quantity to the one

163
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,700
half power, and that's going to hopefully
stop me from making quite

164
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,970
so many I suppose typographical errors
while I'm writing this out.

165
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,522
And so the chain rule then says that the
derivative of g composed with

166
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:40,190
f is going to be the derivative of g so
that's just going to be one half.

167
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,170
Times the quantity x squared plus 1 to the
one half minus 1.

168
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,730
So negative one half.

169
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:52,430
Then times f prime of x.
So, here the f of x is x squared plus 1.

170
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,754
And so, by the power rule I can see

171
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:59,020
that x squared, it's derivative is just
going to be 2x.

172
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,100
Then one is a constant, so it's derivative
is zero.

173
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,380
So I end up multiplying this thing by x,
and then

174
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,520
I can re-write my one half power as a
square root again.

175
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,951
This two over here is going to cancel out
my one half, and so

176
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:16,720
I get a little bit nicer looking format
once I simplify a bit.

177
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,582
And you can do the same thing this is one
examples from the text book.

178
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:26,962
it's exactly the same problem as this one

179
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:29,614
up here just with some different numbers
so, I

180
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,926
have something on the inside and then the

181
00:12:31,926 --> 00:12:36,200
outside function is that raised to the
hundredth power.

182
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,860
So when I take the derivative of that.

183
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,799
First I'm just going to say, 100 times
the,

184
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:45,770
the quantity to the 100 minus 1, so 99.

185
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,670
And then the chain rule says, to get the
derivative right,

186
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,220
I also need to multiply this by the
derivative of the inside.

187
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,246
So that gives me 3x squared over here and

188
00:12:57,246 --> 00:13:01,289
if I simplify the sense of being the
derivative.

189
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,685
If instead we, we think about this using
the Leibniz notation the way I

190
00:13:10,685 --> 00:13:15,730
want to set up problems is using something
called substitution.

191
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,170
So suppose I want to compute the
derivative of the sine of x squared.

192
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,052
Well if I just look at that as one

193
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:26,288
function, I don't know how to take the
derivative

194
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:28,004
of that, but you can see right away that

195
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:30,350
you do know how to take the derivative of
sine.

196
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:30,760
If you

197
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,480
don't you can ask Siri or Google search
Wolfram Alpha

198
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:34,980
[COUGH].

199
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,140
So, what I'm going to do is to find a new
variable u, that's equal to x squared.

200
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,092
And now if I replace x squared with u, I

201
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,960
would know how to take the derivative of
this function.

202
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,830
And so that means my function g of u is
just going to be sin of u.

203
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,040
So it's.

204
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,140
Sin of x squared, if I replace x squared
with u, I just get sin of u.

205
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,752
And then I'm also going to need this du dx
over here,

206
00:14:04,752 --> 00:14:09,180
so I'm going to get that just by taking
the derivative of this.

207
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:15,699
So, the derivative of u, is just going to
be 2x, so du dx is going to equal 2x

208
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:26,210
So if I take the derivative, and this is
where you have to be a bit careful

209
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,674
of not getting variable names confused,
I'm taking the

210
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:33,836
derivative with respect to x of the sin of

211
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:39,695
u, and so that, what the chain rule is
telling me is if I want to do this, I can

212
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:45,926
just take the derivative of sin of u with
respect to u, so that's this first term

213
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,270
in the, in the chain rule.

214
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:53,780
And then, I need to multiply that times
the derivative of my substitution.

215
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,316
So here I've substituted u equals x
squared, so I have to take

216
00:14:57,316 --> 00:15:01,400
the derivative of that, and multiply it in
To whatever I get here.

217
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,962
And so now I can just go ahead and start
evaluating derivatives, so you can

218
00:15:07,962 --> 00:15:09,731
look up the derivative for the sine

219
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:12,240
function, you'll find that it's cosine of
u.

220
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,688
And the derivative of u, with respect to
x, that's easy

221
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:20,800
to get from here, just by using the power
rule, is 2x.

222
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,040
But now I still have a u in my answer
here, but I can just

223
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,060
undo my substitution now by going back and
saying, well, u is equal to x squared.

224
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:30,758
So

225
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:35,920
I end up getting the correct answer here,
2x times cosine of x squared.

226
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:48,168
And so another example Suppose I try to
take the exponential of sin of theta.

227
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:50,630
And I want to take the derivative of this
with respect to theta.

228
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,770
So here I see two functions.

229
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,820
The inside function is going to be the
sine function.

230
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,079
And the outside function is going to be
the exponential function.

231
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,258
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
let u be the value of the inside function.

232
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,630
So I'm going to make the substitution u
equals sign of theta.

233
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:17,730
And then I'll fill in the rest of the
pieces like I did in the first example

234
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,480
so g of u is then just going to be e to
the u.

235
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,120
So I get that just by looking at my
original function and making

236
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,920
the substitution u equals sin of theta or
sin of theta equals u.

237
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:35,333
And then I also need the derivative of my
transformation, or of

238
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:41,906
my substitution so du d theta is just
going to be cosine of theta.

239
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:48,286
So if I take the derivative of ops, the
derivative of this here,

240
00:16:48,286 --> 00:16:53,400
ops with respect to theta.
I'm just going to get cosine of theta.

241
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,740
And then I just start plugging things into
the chain rule.

242
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,110
So I get the derivative with respect to x.
Ops, that should be a theta there.

243
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:08,390
So derivative of E to the sin theta with
respect to theta.

244
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:11,820
Is the derivative of e to the u with
respect

245
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,800
to u times the derivative of u with
respect to theta.

246
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,688
Derivative of e to the u, well we've
already seen

247
00:17:18,688 --> 00:17:22,490
this, this was the special function that's
its own derivative.

248
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,550
So that just stays.
Where did my mouse go.

249
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,830
That, that's not good.
Okay, there it goes.

250
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,118
That just stays e to the u.

251
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:36,074
Du d theta becomes cosine theta and now I
have to, I have

252
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:40,890
this u here which I don't want anymore,
because the answer should be in

253
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,448
terms of theta, so I just have to
substitute backwards and I get

254
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:50,500
the, the final answer, cosine of theta
times e to the sine of theta.

255
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,770
And then just one last rule.

256
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:02,810
So if you have an inverse function, so an
inverse function of a function

257
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:07,822
f of x Is a function f inverse that just
gives me back

258
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:13,250
the argument, so it sort of undoes
whatever my function just did.

259
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,710
So if I take f inverse of f of x, I just
get x back.

260
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,046
And you have to be a little bit

261
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:27,390
careful here because F has to be sort of a
function where this is going to work.

262
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,950
So if I did something that was periodic,
like if

263
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,400
I looked at a sine function or a cosine
function.

264
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,980
That's very easy to take the x variable
and get a y variable.

265
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,778
But if I just tell you the y variable,

266
00:18:40,778 --> 00:18:43,790
there's going to be a whole bunch of x
variables.

267
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,120
That will give you that

268
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,230
same y variable.

269
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:52,340
So you have to define it on a region where
it's one to one both directions.

270
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,040
So that I can actually do this and get
exactly the same x back that I put in.

271
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,250
And so f inverse is then just going to be
a function so f.

272
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,365
Takes a point in a b and gives me back a
point

273
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:12,014
in c d and f inverse is just going to take
that point

274
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:15,129
in c d and give me back my original point
in a

275
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:19,980
b and I have to choose these intervals so
that, that is unique.

276
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,790
So that I can go forward and go back and
get the same answer.

277
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,788
For all of the points in the interval a,
b.

278
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,810
So then there's a rule for computing the
deritivative of the inverse function.

279
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,870
And so as long as this thing in the
denominator, is not equal to zero.

280
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,095
Then the derivative of the inverse
function is just

281
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:47,740
1 divided by f prime evaluated at the
inverse function.

282
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,268
And so just as a quick example, consider
log of e to

283
00:19:54,268 --> 00:19:59,150
the x, so these are functions that are,
kind of, undo one another.

284
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,560
So log of e to the x is always equal to x.

285
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,467
So I'm going to say, my function f is e to
the x.

286
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:16,485
F prime of x, so e to the x is this
special function

287
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:21,389
that's it's own derivative, so f prime is
just e to the x.

288
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,600
And then, f inverse is going to be the log
function.

289
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,910
And so, if I look at the derivative of log
of x.

290
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:41,480
It tells me that I should just take 1
divided by f prime.

291
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,400
So that's e to the x.

292
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,570
Evaluated at f inverse, so f inverse is
log x.

293
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:56,258
So it's e to the log x and so just like we
had log of e to the x was x, here I have

294
00:20:56,258 --> 00:20:59,190
e to the log of x is also x.

295
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:04,160
And so that tells me that the derivative
of the logarithm is 1 over x.

296
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,306
And again, you could ask Wolfram Alpha

297
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,070
what's the derivative of the logarithmic
function.

298
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,825
And it's going to tell you it's 1 over x.

299
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:16,110
Okay so just a quick summary.

300
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:21,220
We had the, the product rule.
So that said the product of two functions,

301
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,880
f of x and g of x, was just, sorry the
derivative of a product.

302
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,015
Is the derivative of the first function
times the second function,

303
00:21:29,015 --> 00:21:32,280
plus the first function times the
derivative of the second functin.

304
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,930
We had the chain rule.

305
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:41,395
So I like this notation a bit better.
So it says that the derivative

306
00:21:41,395 --> 00:21:46,225
of a function of a function.
Is the derivative of the outside

307
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:49,280
function times the derivative of the
inside function.
