1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,120
So we'll pick up, where we left off last
time.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,430
with differentiation.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,650
So last time we, we went through present
value.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,140
We used that, a little bit to motivate the
idea of a limit.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,730
And then I tried to give an example of
when a limit's not going to work.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,050
And when a limit is going to work.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,580
And then I gave some rules for evaluating
limits.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,430
And then we talked about continuity.

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,580
And now we're going to talk about
differentiation.

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:33,360
So differentiation is basically the, the
problem.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,270
We want to solve is we have some curve, so
you can imagine in a xy plane.

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,880
You just define the value of y as some
function of x.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,960
And I want to find the slope of a tangent
line to this curve, at a point a.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,340
So, this is sort of a picture of what I'm
trying to do.

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,850
So, this blue line is my curve, y equals f
of x.

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,900
Then I choose some point a on the x axis.

17
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,460
The corresponding point on the y axis.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,030
So, what's going to make up this curve is
just going to be f of a.

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,212
And, I want to touch a line to this curve,

20
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:16,560
so that it only touches at exactly one
point.

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,770
And I'm going to call that a tangent line.

22
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,734
And the problem I'm trying to solve is if
I know this point

23
00:01:23,734 --> 00:01:27,220
right here, I want to know what the slope
of this tangent line is.

24
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,179
And so just to make that, this idea of a
tangent line a, a little bit more rigorous

25
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:45,468
I want to say that there's a a
neighborhood of width

26
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:50,370
delta, so it's delta to either side of
this point a.

27
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,010
And I'm going to say that this line here,
so

28
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:58,103
the the straight line is tangent to the
curve.

29
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:01,283
If f of x so l of x is going to be my line
f

30
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:05,947
of x is my function, if f of x is equal to
my function if

31
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:11,883
l of x is less than or equal to f of x so
in my little neighborhood there

32
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:18,112
goes to delta of either side because I'm
using a round bracket here.

33
00:02:18,112 --> 00:02:21,432
I mean every point up to a but not
including a, so

34
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:25,084
every point less than a down to a minus
delta and every

35
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:28,404
point greater than a up to a plus delta, I
need to

36
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:31,226
have f of x greater than l of x so that
means

37
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:34,631
the curve has to be above the line
everywhere.

38
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:37,490
Or it has to be below the line everywhere.

39
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:43,350
So basically, what I'm trying to, to do by
having these two conditions.

40
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,590
I either have this shape here.
So the line is always below the curve.

41
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,330
Or I just have that upside down, so the
line would always be above the curve.

42
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,950
And I just need to have that true in some
little neighborhood.

43
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,238
So you can imagine.
A neighborhood about that

44
00:02:56,238 --> 00:02:57,740
big around the point.

45
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,952
And I'm going to say then that this line
is tangent to the curve at

46
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:04,950
that point as long as f of a is equal to l
of a.

47
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,450
So, the function and the line have to have
the same value at a.

48
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,802
So, it touches at just one point but any
little bit to either side of that

49
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:15,454
point, the line is either always greater
than

50
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:17,850
the curve or always less than the curve.

51
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,070
So, that'll be a tangent line.

52
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:21,457
And the

53
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:26,155
interpretation I'm going to give that is
the slope of this tangent

54
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:29,990
line is going to be the slope of the curve
at the point.

55
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,696
So at this big blue point, the slope of
this curve

56
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:36,590
is going to be equal to the slope of that
tangent line.

57
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,195
So that's the problem I'm going to be
trying to solve by differentiation.

58
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:48,600
And so the way I'm going to approach that,
is, I'm going to try and approximate it.

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,540
So the normal definition of slope is rise
over run.

60
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,280
So, you know, you go forward a certain
amount.

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,080
You go up a certain amount.

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,180
And if I go up more, it's steeper.

63
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,120
If I go up less, it's, you know, less
steep.

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,655
But that's the concept I have of slope.
And so if I tried to just do this

65
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:12,140
approximation but using only one point,
it's not going to work.

66
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,857
So I have to pick two different points and
there has to be some non-zero

67
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:19,950
distance between them in the x direction
and so I'm going to call that the run.

68
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,870
And then I just evaluate the function at
the two points.

69
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,770
So I have f of x and f of x plus h.

70
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,970
And that's going to give me the, the
difference in height.

71
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,140
And so that becomes the rise.

72
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:37,060
And so in this picture because these
points are reasonably far apart.

73
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,420
I don't get a particularly good estimate
of what I'm after.

74
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,690
So this, this line, you know, it, it
clearly looks like it's steeper

75
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,840
than the curve at the point x where I'm
trying to estimate the slopes.

76
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,450
So it's a lot steeper than, ops.

77
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,740
If I go back one slide, it's a lot steeper
than this line that I'm trying to,

78
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,705
trying to find.

79
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,170
Oh, ops, I guess I had it one forward
there.

80
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,612
But, the idea is now once I've set this
up, so

81
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:14,350
I have an estimate of the slope, so rise
over run.

82
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,510
So, it's f of x plus h minus f of x.

83
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,820
So, that's just this distance here, the
rise.

84
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,580
And then, the run is just going to be h.

85
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,579
So, it's x plus h minus x.

86
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,048
And I'm just going to try and improve my
estimate by letting this

87
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:34,850
point here, so the one on the right,
because I'm adding h.

88
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,910
I'm going to let that point slide along
the curve towards

89
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,670
x and hopefully as, as I get closer to x.

90
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,634
So as h is getting smaller The slope of
this line here is

91
00:05:47,634 --> 00:05:51,255
getting closer and closer to the slope of
the line on the right

92
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:55,870
until finally in the limit hopefully the
slope of my approximation is going to

93
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,926
be the same as the slope of the tangent
line that I'm trying to get.

94
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,030
And so that's actually how we're going to
define the derivative.

95
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,040
So the derivative.

96
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,866
And we'll say a function f is
differentiable

97
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:17,819
at a point x, so it's this point x here,
if the

98
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:23,270
limit of my rise over run approximation
exists.

99
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,905
So I'm basically, I'm just looking at.

100
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,439
The rise divided by the run taking the
limit as that, as the

101
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,850
sort of bottom side of that triangle goes
to zero.

102
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,048
If that exists then I'm going to say the
derivative

103
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:39,950
exists so the function is differentiable
at this point x.

104
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,460
And I'm going to call that f prime of x.

105
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,210
So f prime of x Is my notation for the
derivative of f of x.

106
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,874
And then just like for continuity, we're
going to say a

107
00:06:55,874 --> 00:07:00,060
function f of x is differentiable on an
open interval a, b.

108
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,862
If it is differentiable at every point in
a, b.

109
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:12,060
And so for a lot of functions, it's just
going to work on the entire real line.

110
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,893
If it's you know if it's differentiable

111
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:16,060
at all, it's differentiable at every real
number.

112
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,935
But you do have to be a little bit
careful,

113
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:22,320
so open, here, means that the interval
doesn't include the endpoints.

114
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,422
And so that's why I've used

115
00:07:25,422 --> 00:07:29,030
the parentheses here rather than square
brackets.

116
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,226
And the only reason we have to do this, is

117
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:36,335
imagine if I wanted to compute the
derivative at b.

118
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:38,829
So the, where I'm going to run into a

119
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:42,269
problem, is in order to compute the
derivative

120
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:44,330
at b, I'd have a b here.

121
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,970
And I have to add, ops, I have to add a
little bit of h to that b.

122
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,336
And if I can actually use the very last
point in the interval,

123
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:56,180
then if I add h to that, I'm going to be
outside of my interval.

124
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,698
So I have to just chop off the

125
00:07:57,698 --> 00:08:01,180
last point and surprisingly that actually
always works.

126
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,830
So I can always find enough points to make
this limit exist.

127
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,828
And so for, for the purpose of this class
we're really

128
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:17,760
going to be more interested in actually
being able to compute limits.

129
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:20,670
Oh, sorry, to compute derivatives.

130
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,718
So, we can use just the definition of a
derivitive to

131
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:28,730
try and figure out what the The derivative
of a function is.

132
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:34,870
So for a, a quick example of this, just
consider this quadratic expression here.

133
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,274
So 3x squared

134
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:41,122
plus 5x plus 1.
So if I want to compute the derivative of

135
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:46,830
f of x using the definition Well, this is
my definition.

136
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,450
So I'm just going to start plugging things
into the definition and see what happens.

137
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,840
So the first thing I want to do is
evaluate my function f at x plus h.

138
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,480
So what that means I'm going to do is
replace every x up here.

139
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,050
With the quantity x plus h.

140
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:12,570
So now I have 3 times x plus h squared,
plus 5 times x plus h, plus 1.

141
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,490
So that's just this function up here
evaluated at the point x plus h.

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,192
Then I'm going to subtract f of x.
So that's just

143
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:30,450
me substituting in the definition of f of
x for this particular exercise.

144
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,776
And divide by h, and then, I'm going to

145
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:36,270
try and evaluate this limit and see what
happens.

146
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,710
And so the, the way you generally approach
this when

147
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,380
you have a, a polynomial, you just expand
These things, and

148
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,795
do the math and see what pops out.
And so that's what I've done

149
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:56,670
here, so x plus h squared is going to be x
squared plus 2xh plus h squared.

150
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,570
So I multiply that by three, and that's
where this bit comes from.

151
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,460
Then I have plus 5x and plus 5h.

152
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,900
That, it's here.
And then plus 1.

153
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,400
And then I'm just going to subtract each
of these terms.

154
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,928
And so what ends up happening is my, my

155
00:10:14,928 --> 00:10:18,730
3x squared here, and 3x, negative 3x
squared here.

156
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,680
That gets rid of that x squared term.

157
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,442
I have a plus 1 here.

158
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:28,440
And a minus 1 here, a minus 5x and a plus
5x.

159
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,486
So a lot of these things are going to
cancel

160
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:32,718
each other out and if it works out, what's

161
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:34,888
going to happen is only the terms up here
that

162
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:37,130
still have an h in them are going to be
left.

163
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:37,487
Once I do

164
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:44,290
just this subtraction in the numerator.
So I end up with 6xh

165
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:50,270
3h squared and 5h, and I'm dividing that
by h.

166
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,710
And because I'm looking at the limit as h
goes to

167
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,520
zero I can pretend that h is always
greater than zero.

168
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,981
So if h is greater than zero I can
multiply the

169
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:02,609
top and the bottom by one over h, and get
rid

170
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:04,070
of this h in the bottom.

171
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,460
And so that means I can cancel out one h
from each term in the top.

172
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,097
So I end up with the limit as h goes to
zero, of 6x plus 3h plus 5.

173
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:22,540
And now this is a continuous function.
So it means that the limit as h goes to

174
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,772
zero is just equal to that function
evaluated at zero so I can just put Plug

175
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:31,410
in zero for h here.
And I get 6x plus 5.

176
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:37,938
And so this is telling me that the, the
slope of this curve

177
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:44,153
at a point x is equal to 6x plus 5.
Okay.

178
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,190
And really what we're going to do with the
derivative,

179
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,600
so sort of like continuity, or sort of
like limits.

180
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,100
Working with the definition is not very
much fun.

181
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,165
So what we want to do is use the
definition to

182
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:59,670
prove some rules that are going to make
computing derivatives easier.

183
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,685
So all of these rules can be proved, and
if you, if you

184
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:07,118
took a more rigorous math class that's
sort of what they would do.

185
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:12,776
we're going to be moving a bit faster, so
I'm just going to say the rules.

186
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:15,520
if you look in the textbook, there will be
proofs of some of these.

187
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,445
Or if you look in a first year calculus
book

188
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:22,200
in particular Stewart has all the proofs
for these things.

189
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,260
So the derivative of a constant is zero.
So if you ever see a constant.

190
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,324
That's something you're pretty happy to
take the

191
00:12:30,324 --> 00:12:32,210
derivative of, it's hardly any work at
all.

192
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:36,400
second property is linearity.

193
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,810
So linearity means that if I have two
functions, so f of x and g of x.

194
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,670
And really what you're going to do is

195
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,310
you're generally going to be given one
function and

196
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,350
you're going to look at that and say that

197
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,838
one function is really made up of two
functions.

198
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:56,920
Two simpler functions, how am I going to
take the derivative of that?

199
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,570
And so, if I have f

200
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:06,608
of x and g of x differentiable functions,
and if a and b are real valued constants,

201
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:14,350
then I'm going to define l of x is a
linear combination of f of x And g of x.

202
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,030
If I just say a times f of x plus b times
g of x.

203
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,042
And the derivative of l of x,

204
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:25,332
so for, for linear combinations of
differentiable functions,

205
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:29,110
the derivative of a sum is just the sum of
the derivative.

206
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,568
So the derivative of this Is the sum of
the derivative

207
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:37,540
of the first term ops, and the derivative
of the second term.

208
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,960
And also note what happens to the
constant.

209
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,730
So if I have a times f of x, then the
derivative is just a times f prime of x.

210
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,490
So if I make the function twice as big.

211
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,690
Then the derivative, you know, at every
point that sort of

212
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,146
going to be twice as steep, so really
what's happening when you

213
00:13:57,146 --> 00:14:00,602
multiply something by a, say, a is two,
that it stretches your

214
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:04,320
function, so that it's twice as tall as it
used to be.

215
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,758
And when you do that, what you're going to
end up doing

216
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:09,520
is just making the derivative twice as
steep as it used to be.

217
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,840
And then the final rule is called the
power rule.

218
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,780
So, sorry, final rule for this section.

219
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:25,498
There will be more rules.
So let n be a real valued constant.

220
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,980
Then the derivative of x to the n.

221
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,078
So for instance, this could be x squared,

222
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,910
x cubed, something like that, or any real
value.

223
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:39,672
So, x to the 2.5.
The derivative of that function

224
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:42,446
is n times x to the n minus 1.

225
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:50,200
And so, this this simple little trick is
called the power rule.

226
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,823
And then you can make combinations of the
power rule and this linearity property

227
00:14:54,823 --> 00:14:56,755
and that makes it possible to take

228
00:14:56,755 --> 00:15:00,160
the derivative of polynomials without too
much trouble.

229
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,108
So just a, a quick summary that definition
of

230
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:08,810
a derivative was f prime of x is the
limit.

231
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,850
Of f of x plus h minus f of x divided by
h.

232
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:20,382
So, that's just the limit of of the rise
over the run, as the run is going to zero.

233
00:15:20,382 --> 00:15:24,318
Deriv derivative of a constant is zero, so
if f of

234
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:28,542
x is equal to the same value, no matter
where I choose

235
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:34,490
x that just means f of x is a flat line.
Then a derivative of a flat line is zero.

236
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,510
The slope of a flat line is zero.

237
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,020
Linearity so if I have a linear
combination of two differentiable

238
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:47,350
functions f of x and g of x, then the
derivative is just the linear combination

239
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,860
of the two derivatives.
So, af prime of x plus bg prime of x.

240
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,000
And then, the power rule.

241
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,630
And so, this time, instead of n, I wrote
it as c.

242
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,150
So, c is supposed to be my, my letter for
a real valued constant.

243
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:07,576
so for any c not equal to zero, x to the
c,

244
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:12,493
the derivative of that is c times x to the
c minus 1.

245
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:12,494
