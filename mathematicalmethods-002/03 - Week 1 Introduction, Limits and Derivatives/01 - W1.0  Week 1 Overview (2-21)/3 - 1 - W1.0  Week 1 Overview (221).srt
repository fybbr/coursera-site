1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,590
The topic for week one is limits and
derivatives.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,980
And the topics we're going to cover are,
so

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,950
I'll start of with a concept called
present value,

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,050
and this is just a way to decide how

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,490
much a future stream of payments is worth
today.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,880
And then I'm going to use the idea of

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,070
present value to motivate a mathematical
idea called a limit.

8
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,070
And a limit is just,

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,450
it's the value of a sequence of functions
or

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:33,220
a sequence of numbers as you just keep
going.

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,850
So it's something that you can never
actually

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,240
arrive at, but it's something you can
approximate.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,970
In section four, we'll talk about
evaluating limits, so

14
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,470
this is a very a very common mathematical
operation.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,560
Section five, I'll introduce a concept
called continuity, and so you can think of

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,210
a continuous function as just one that you
could draw without lifting up your pen.

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,760
Mathematically, the way I would say that
is that

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,470
a continuous function is a function where
the limit

19
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,920
of a function as I approach a certain
value

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,740
is just equal to the function evaluated at
that value.

21
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,648
In section six, I am going to then apply
the limit to a.

22
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,280
To an estimate of the slope of a function.

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,560
And then when I take the limit I end up

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,630
with something called a derivative, so
that's, going to be differentiation.

25
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,420
And on the rest of the lecture, is

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,060
just going to be methods for evaluating
derivatives.

27
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,760
So we'll talk about something called the
product rule and the chain rule.

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,280
So this is when I have

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,500
a, a complicated function, a function
that's made up of smaller functions.

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,340
I can express the derivative of my
function

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,750
in terms of the derivatives of those
smaller functions.

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,070
I can do higher derivatives, so a higher
derivative

33
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,740
is just a derivative of a derivative of a
function.

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,690
And then, I'll give an example using a
concept called Duration Of A Bond.

35
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,410
And then, finally, finish this week with

36
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:04,920
L'Hopital's Rule.

37
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,540
And L'Hopital's Rule is a way of
evaluating a limit

38
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,040
that's undefined.

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,990
So, I could end up with a limit of, of
something like 0 divided by 0.

40
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,270
I can actually use derivatives to make
sense of a limit like that.
