1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,570
So now we get to start with the actual
content of the course.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,740
I'll start with the idea called present
value.

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,480
So, we're going to start out with, just
talking about interest.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,195
So you can think about this you know,

5
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:21,730
pretty much everyone has some sort of bank
account.

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,987
So if you think of a savings account, you
put

7
00:00:23,987 --> 00:00:27,280
money in your savings account and then
periodically the bank.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,300
Or whoever is holding your savings account
gives you a little bit as

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,059
a reward for letting the, letting the bank
hold on to your money.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,776
And so for simple interest,

11
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:43,242
this is the easiest possible way that a
bank can pay you interest.

12
00:00:43,242 --> 00:00:48,277
money is going to accumulate proportional
to the total time of the

13
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:54,540
investment.
So here r is my interest rate.

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,740
So you could think about this as the
yearly

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,400
interest rate, so maybe, you know, 4% per
year.

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,972
n is the number

17
00:01:03,972 --> 00:01:13,300
of periods, and A zero is going to be my
initial amount that I put in the bank.

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,984
And so the way this is going to work is,
it's a single

19
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:19,930
interest payment that just happens at the
end of whatever agreement I have.

20
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,162
So if I, if I said I'm going to put this
money into a bank

21
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:29,130
account for one year, then I would get 1
plus r times A 0, out at

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,260
the very end.

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,275
If I put it in for two years I would get 1
plus 2 r times A0

24
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:40,790
at the end of two years, so its a linear
function here in the number of years.

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,464
And then compound interest, simple
interest,

26
00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:48,960
I don't think this really happens.

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,600
Too much anywhere, any more.

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,668
But you know, back when it was difficult
to do mathematics before

29
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:57,080
computers, things like that, this, this
was probably a lot more common.

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,600
Compound interest is interest paid
regularly.

31
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,000
So let's see if I can understand what my
slide is here.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,326
So basically,

33
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:15,058
what's happening here, v is going to be my
value in the future, A0 is going to

34
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:21,700
be my initial deposit, 1 plus r times A0,
that's going to be the values.

35
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,234
Oops, that's going to be the value after
one

36
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:29,940
time period, and notice it's in these red
brackets here.

37
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,370
And so when, when I go to

38
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,790
the second time period, I get 1 plus r
times what's in the red brackets.

39
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,840
So that means I'm going to get some
interest on the interest this time.

40
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,060
And so you can sort of see that, oops,
sort of see that as 1 plus r times A1.

41
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,530
So you can pick up A0 is the amount in my
account is my initial deposit.

42
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,380
A1 is the amount after one time period, so
say one year.

43
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,510
Then after two time periods, I'm going to
have 1 plus r.

44
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,340
Times what I had at the end of the first
period.

45
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,770
And the way that's going to end up looking
mathematically,

46
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,410
is just 1 plus r to the nth power times my
initial investment.

47
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,790
And then, you can make this formula a
little bit more general.

48
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,790
So it might, in the second bullet here
compound

49
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,210
interest, I'm just receiving one interest
payment per year.

50
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,910
But quite often the compound interest is
going to be stated in a year license.

51
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,514
So if somebody says you know, the interest
on this

52
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:44,517
account is 2.5%, they mean you're paying
2.5% per year.in the.

53
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:47,451
But they might be paying you interest
monthly.

54
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:49,299
So in every statement, you get a little

55
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:52,220
interest payment that's going into your
savings account.

56
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,699
And so the way we're going to handle that
is you're just

57
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:01,880
going to have r, which is the yearly
interest rate, divided by m.

58
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,230
So this is going to be the number of
times.

59
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,170
That it gets paid.

60
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,295
So the, you know, the key ones are
probably going to be quarterly,

61
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:11,562
monthly or daily.

62
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,396
So in that case you know, if it's
quarterly n would

63
00:04:15,396 --> 00:04:17,730
be 4, if montly, n would be 12 and so on.

64
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,972
And then it's basically the same formula
that you

65
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:26,330
have here, except that I'm just changing r
to be.

66
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:30,480
in some sort of different units.

67
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,310
And then k instead of being now measured
in years, it's just measured in periods.

68
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,594
So if m is dividing the year into 12
periods then k

69
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:44,490
equals 1 is going to be the value after
the first month.

70
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,174
k equals 2 is the value after the second
month and so on.

71
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,059
And then just so that the slide will be
useful as a reference when

72
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:56,170
you're trying to think about this later,
here's all of the terms that I have.

73
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,930
So, to make it fit on one line I had to
say r equals rate.

74
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,190
That's the interest rate.

75
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,120
And, yeah, so I think everything else
should be clear there.

76
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:18,240
So, present and future value.
So, suppose the interest rate is 4%.

77
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,624
Then in one years time, if I make an
initial deposit, if

78
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:25,640
I go to the bank and put $100 in a
saving's account.

79
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,230
After I get my interest payment in one
year.

80
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,540
My savings account is going to have $104
in it.

81
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,380
So one year from now, I have $104.

82
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,961
So, kind of in our present value,

83
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:43,937
future value terminology, I would say that
the future value of my $100 now is $104.

84
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:47,740
And present value I'm going to get just be
turning that around.

85
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,130
So if I know that my $100 now is worth
$104.

86
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:57,128
A year in the future, but I also know that
the present value

87
00:05:57,128 --> 00:06:02,180
of $104 a year in the future, is worth a
$100 now.

88
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,330
And so without too much trouble you should
be able to work out this formula.

89
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,727
So the future value is just equal to, 1
plus r times

90
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:14,319
the present value, where r is the interest
rate for the time period.

91
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,843
And ten we can get an expression for

92
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:20,500
the present value just by doing some
simple algebra.

93
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,690
So we get present value is equal to 1

94
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,500
divided by 1 plus r times the future
values.

95
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,960
And we're going to call this factor 1
divided by 1 plus r

96
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,716
a discount.
So what I want to do is, discount

97
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:41,039
a future value to come up with some idea
of what that's worth now.

98
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,674
And I'm going to call that my present
value, and so will call

99
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:52,194
d1 a discount factor so, because I haven't
put the over

100
00:06:52,194 --> 00:06:57,160
m here this is all on kind of a yearly
basis.

101
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,672
But just like on the last slide, we can
mess around with this and

102
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:07,890
get a discount for a finer grain of
interest payments.

103
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,796
And then with this discount factor, d sub
k, we can say the

104
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:18,600
present value of a payment a sub k,
received after k periods.

105
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:25,640
Is just A sub k discounted by the
appropriate discount factor d sub k.

106
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:35,260
And now we're going to look at a financial
product, or a contract, called an annuity.

107
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,768
And this is just a contract where I buy it

108
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:41,800
now, and what I'm buying is some future
stream of payments.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,796
And my question is, suppose I want to buy
an annuity that pays $100 at the end of

110
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:58,390
the year for each of the next ten years,
and the current interest rate is 4%.

111
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,460
So how much would I expect to pay?

112
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,450
So you could kind of get an idea of how
much this thing should be.

113
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,850
Just that you know the interest rate is
never very big.

114
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,240
I mean today 4% is extraordinary.

115
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,151
My savings account right

116
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:16,792
now pays 1/10th of 1% so it's uh.You know
if we go much

117
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:21,979
further we might not be even have to learn
this accounting any more

118
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:25,528
so if I did a discount if I said $100 in a
year

119
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:31,019
is worth $100 now I'm going to be paid ten
times $1000 per year.

120
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:38,019
The money now would still be better, but
but I would be willing to pay something

121
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:43,119
close to, but not, not, never more than
$1000 for ten

122
00:08:43,119 --> 00:08:48,750
yearly payments of $100.
But if we want to be mathematically

123
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,158
correct about this, what we really want to
do is discount each

124
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:59,200
of the ten future payments, and then sum
up all of those.

125
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,998
And that's going to give me the present

126
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,376
value for this stream of payments, so
receiving

127
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,370
$100 a year for the next ten years.

128
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,160
So, we just start plugging numbers into
the formulas on the, on the last slide.

129
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,720
And we get the present value of the kth
payment is just going to be.

130
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:25,990
So d sub k, if m is equal to 1, then 1
divided by this, oops, 1 divided by that.

131
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,800
That's my discount factor.

132
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,420
And then the a sub k is always going to be
100, because I'm always getting $100.

133
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,536
So this is the present value

134
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:36,420
of the payment received in period k.

135
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,890
Then the value of the whole annuity is
just going to be the sum of those.

136
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,970
And so I get a, a formula that looks like
this.

137
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,410
And that probably doesn't look too
intimidating.

138
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,424
I mean you could stick that into a
spreadsheet

139
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:52,360
pretty easily and figure out figure out
what that's worth.

140
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,717
But, you know when people were working up
these

141
00:09:55,717 --> 00:09:58,530
formulas in the first place, there were no
spreadsheets.

142
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,470
And some said at maths class, we're going
to do it the way the old people did.

143
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:09,110
So, we'll start off with, this is just
what I had on the last line of this slide.

144
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,920
So, the value of the annuity is.

145
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,317
The sum of these ten payments,
appropriately

146
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:19,200
discounted for, for being in the future.

147
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,430
And so, you know, the one way I could do
it, just actually write down everything.

148
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,000
It's going to take a while, but you will
get the right answer,

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,440
but what we want is a short-cut, and so
the, the trick we use to get that.

150
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,588
As I'm, I'm going to multiply v by
whatever's in the denominator here, but

151
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:46,920
not, not with the power.
So, just 1 plus 0.04 times v.

152
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,082
And what that's going to do is if I, if I

153
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:55,028
multiplied both sides of this thing up
here by 1.04.

154
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:57,764
Its just going to knock out one of these
things

155
00:10:57,764 --> 00:11:00,804
in the denominator here, and leave me with
this

156
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:02,360
thing on the left side.

157
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:08,454
So for the, when k is equal to 1 I'm
going to have 1.04

158
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:13,639
on the bottom here, times 1.04 and that's
where this 100 comes from.

159
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,597
Then I'm going to have the remaining nine
of these things and

160
00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:20,290
the only place, there is a K is down at
the bottom here.

161
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,073
So I'm just going to change this as the
sum from 1

162
00:11:24,073 --> 00:11:28,310
to 9 of 100 divided by 1 plus 0.04 to the
k.

163
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:29,943
So I hope

164
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:32,565
that's clear how that one worked, but if
its

165
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:35,549
not just write it down with instead of 10
here.

166
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,530
Write it out without the summation
notation with 4, maybe 3 or 4 terms.

167
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,470
And just do it, and you'll see what's
happening.

168
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,320
And then what I'm going to do is, I'm

169
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,530
going to write the original thing we had
underneath it.

170
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:54,820
So I had the sum from 1 to 10 of 100
divided by, my discount factor.

171
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,525
But instead of write, writing that out as
just

172
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:01,385
the summation, I'm going to write that out
as sum from

173
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:05,620
1 to 9, and then just add on what I would
have put in there for the tenth term.

174
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,004
And now I subtract these things, so this,
this guy over here is a

175
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:15,280
little red subtraction sign, I think
Manage to put a line in my slide, too.

176
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,800
So it's supposed to look like kind of a
elementary school maths problem.

177
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,102
If I now subtract

178
00:12:21,102 --> 00:12:24,822
the bottom line from the top line, I'll
have 1

179
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:29,380
plus 0.04 v minus v, so that's going to be
0.04 v.

180
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,970
100 minus, well, there's nothing behind,
nothing below that.

181
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,450
So there's going to be 100 here.

182
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,710
This term here, oops, is the same as this
term here.

183
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,290
So those are going to cancel each other
out when I do the subtraction.

184
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,218
And then I'm going to have minus this
thing on the right hand

185
00:12:46,218 --> 00:12:47,120
side over here.

186
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,656
So now I've managed to get an expression

187
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:55,790
involving v, and not involving the sum any
more.

188
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:01,448
And so, it doesn't matter if I want from 1
to 10 or 1 to 1,000, basically

189
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:07,730
the information I need to get to recover v
is kind of somehow contained in just the.

190
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,930
You know, the, the very first and very
last of those terms, if you're clever.

191
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,043
And so that is just a little algebra
exercise

192
00:13:17,043 --> 00:13:20,300
to figure out what this annuity should be
worth.

193
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,875
So I ended up coming up with $811.9.

194
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,298
So now we're going look at this as the
number of

195
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:33,840
periods gets longer and so there's
something called a perpetual annuity.

196
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:39,490
or a perpetuity and this is going to pay
$100 per time period.

197
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,800
So say $100 a year.
But the payments never stop.

198
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,340
It just.
Just keeps going so, forever.

199
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,800
And I actually thought this was something
that

200
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,950
they invented just, you know, for
economics 101

201
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,760
text books to kind of work through this
example.

202
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,720
But apparently they actually exist,
there's

203
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,480
something in the U.K. Called a console.

204
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,040
Which, you buy and it pays you forever.

205
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,220
And so we'll sort of just try to do the
same thing that we did last time.

206
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,710
So, the only difference is now instead of
going from one to ten.

207
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,390
You know, I'm going from one to infinity.

208
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:23,170
And so when I pop off this first term, so
when I multiply by the.

209
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,130
The 1 plus 0.04.

210
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,740
I still have an infinite number of terms
trailing off in the end.

211
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,784
But this hundred does

212
00:14:31,784 --> 00:14:32,680
pop out in front.

213
00:14:35,438 --> 00:14:37,090
And I'm going to do exactly the same
thing.

214
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,130
Subtract the v.

215
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:39,720
But now.

216
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,798
And this is kind of clever, but
essentially

217
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,430
what's happening is, you know, as I go

218
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,398
further and further into the future, you
know,

219
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:49,444
the money that I receive 1000 years from
now.

220
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:52,244
you know, really this whole exercise seems
kind of silly to

221
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:55,420
me, because I'm going to be dead in
probably 60 or 70 years.

222
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,230
There's no point in me thinking about
money I'm going to receive in 1000 years.

223
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,574
But it's

224
00:15:00,574 --> 00:15:03,950
getting, you know, this discount factor on
the bottom's getting really, really small.

225
00:15:05,344 --> 00:15:08,965
I'm sorry, the discount factor's getting
really small,

226
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:13,120
the thing in the denominator here is
getting big.

227
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,001
And so that means these future, future

228
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:17,810
payments just their present value's
effectively zero.

229
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,550
So again we do the subtraction, but this
time

230
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,230
I just find out that 0.04, so that's the
interest

231
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,270
rate, times the value of my annuity, is
then

232
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,280
just equal to the payment that I'm
receiving every year.

233
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,150
And so, again, I can just solve that
simple algebra exercise.

234
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:48,510
And get, 2,500, okay.

235
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,300
So a quick summary of, my present value
slide.

236
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,190
So this is the formula for the discount
factor.

237
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:58,060
So m is the number of periods, r is the
yearly interest

238
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,586
rate and then k is the index for period
that you are

239
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,460
receiving the payment.

240
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,766
The value of an annuity that pays a an
amount annually at an

241
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:15,550
annual interest rate r for n total
payments is given by this formula.

242
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,916
So this is just the same one we had on

243
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:23,786
the previous slide, but with the a over r
factored out.

244
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:28,376
And then value v of perpetual annuity,
that pays an

245
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:31,976
amount a annually at an interest rate r,
is just

246
00:16:31,976 --> 00:16:32,830
a over r.

247
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:37,012
And you can kind of see that from this,
this expression here,

248
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:40,630
you know, the 1 divided by 1 plus r to the
n.

249
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,158
As n gets bigger and bigger this
denominator is going to get bigger and

250
00:16:44,158 --> 00:16:47,930
bigger and so the, the second term is
getting closer and closer to 0.

251
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,030
So, you know, hopefully this v is kind of

252
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,210
getting close to, to this v in the bottom
one.

253
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,140
As you let the number of periods increase.
