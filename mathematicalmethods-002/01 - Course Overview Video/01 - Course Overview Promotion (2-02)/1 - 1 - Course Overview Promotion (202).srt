Hi, my name's Chao Kunnes.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,860
I'm a new professor in the Computational
Finance and Risk Management

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,470
Program, in the Department of Applied

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,830
Mathematics at the University of
Washington.

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,410
And I'm going to be offering a course

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,990
called Mathematical Methods for
Quantitative Finance on Coursera.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,770
So, a little bit about my background.

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,470
I did a masters degree in applied
mathematics and

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,120
then a doctorate in statistics at the
University of Oxford.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,080
And then I did

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,400
a four year postdoc, at the Swiss

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,260
Federal Institute of Technology in
Lausanne, Switzerland.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,410
Now, I've just joined the department here

14
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,540
with a research area in computational
finance, where

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,200
I'm hoping to apply some of my

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,651
knowledge of statistics to problems in
quantitative finance.

17
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:48,510
So the course I'm going to be offering is
going

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,080
to be a pre-program course for our Masters
program.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,350
It's going to cover single and
multivariable calculus, linear algebra,

20
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:00,330
optimization methods in finance and then
numerical

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,525
techniques for solving these sorts of
problems.

22
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:08,430
And the motivation for this course really
came from a lot of the students we were

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,905
getting who are interested in applying for
our Masters in computational finance.

24
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:16,960
And this is a very mathematical degree and
we were finding that a lot of

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,070
otherwise well qualified people, people
who had either

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,720
been working for several years in industry
or

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,010
had undergraduate degrees in economics or
business

28
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,690
finance, who would be ideal candidates for
our

29
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:34,380
Masters program, who are just a little bit
ill prepared when it came to mathematics.

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,150
And so we want to offer a course that's

31
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,470
going to bring people like that up to
speed.

32
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,380
And this would be useful, you know, if
you're looking to, get an internship

33
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,130
or a job in the finance industry or if
you're interested in pursuing a degree

34
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,212
in mathematical finance.

35
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:52,800
And so, if you feel like you would fall
into either of these two

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,765
groups of people, I'd really like to
invite you to take my course on Coursera.

37
00:01:56,765 --> 00:01:57,710
Thank you very much.
