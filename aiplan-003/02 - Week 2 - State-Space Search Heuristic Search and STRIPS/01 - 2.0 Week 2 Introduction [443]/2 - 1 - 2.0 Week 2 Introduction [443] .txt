Welcome to week 2 of the AI planning 
course. 
We've already learned a lot of things in 
week 1. 
For example I've introduced to you the 
basic planning problem which is the 
problem we are addressing in this course. 
I've also told you about a technique that 
is used in many places in AI but 
specifically it's very important to 
planning and that technique is search. 
Then we've met some of our friends the 
duck worker robots an example we will be 
using throughout the course. 
This was followed by my colleague Austin 
Tate telling you about practical planners 
and applications where these are used. 
But planning is not just about finding 
plans there is also a context to planning 
and this is for example what happens 
before a planning mainly the assignment 
of tasks to Planners. 
And after planning, the plan execution 
which is very important. 
Then, we've also seen that there is a 
range of techniques that are used in 
planners today. 
That was pretty much what we've learned 
in Week 1. 
And now I want to talk a little bit about 
the website. 
I've already seen a lot of you have used 
the social platform that comes with this 
course, which you can see here. 
And I would like to encourage you to use 
the discussion forums. 
To bring up any questions, any issues, 
that you have with the course material 
and hopefully some of the the community 
that uses this forum will answer those 
questions for you or we, the instructors, 
can help as well. 
In this week's first segment we'll be 
looking at informed search or more 
specifically the A* search algorithm. 
A* is a search algorithm just like the 
ones we've seen last week. 
It takes an implicit graph and searches 
it in its basic form as a tree. 
Shown here is the search tree generated 
by the A* algorithm for the touring 
Romania problem where the task is to get 
from Arad to Bucharest. 
What is new here, is that the algorithm 
uses a number to guide its search, and 
this number expresses how far from the 
search node the algorithm thinks the 
current node is. 
This is called a heuristic. 
And this heuristic is used to compute 
some evaluation function that tells the 
algorithm which node to expand next. 
In this graph, we see the numbers here 
which are the value of this evaluation 
function. 
So, what this algorithm does is use an 
informed search strategy, as opposed to 
the uninformed search strategies we've 
seen so far. 
And probably the best known informed 
search strategy in the A start algorithm 
which is what we will see in the first 
segment this week. 
In this week's second segment we will be 
seeing our first planning algorithm which 
is the forward state space. 
Search/g algorithm. 
This uses the search technology we've 
seen in the previous segment. 
As you will see in detail, this algorithm 
is actually very simple. 
It takes a planning problem as input, 
which is these three components you see 
here. 
And then starts a loop where it starts 
from the initial state and builds up a 
plan starting from an empty plan. 
That will satisfy the goal. 
The first thing it does is the goal test, 
which is just what we've seen in our 
search algorithm. 
So this is the goal test here. 
And then generates all the applicable 
actions in the current state. 
If there are none, then of course we have 
failed. 
Otherwise it just chooses one of the 
applicable actions. 
That is our new action that we apply in 
our state. 
Then we go to a new state by going 
forward from our current state. 
And extend our plan with this current 
action. 
And we go through this loop, until we 
have reached a goal state. 
And therefore we have found a plan that 
achieves our goal. 
But before we get to this algorithm, we 
will see a formal definition of what 
constitutes a planning problem. 
And most importantly we will see the 
scripts representation for operators, 
which is the set O here, which describes 
an operator as something consisting of 
preconditions and effects. 
That's what we will look at later this 
week. 
So now it's time to get into the material 
for week 2. 
Week 1 was fairly lightweight, and you've 
seen an informal introduction to 
planning. 
In Week 2, we will see the material a lot 
more technical. 
We will introduce algorithms, and you 
will have something to implement, if you 
want.
