00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,142
Welcome to week 2 of the AI planning 
course. 

2
00:00:03,142 --> 00:00:06,537
We've already learned a lot of things in 
week 1. 

3
00:00:06,537 --> 00:00:11,822
For example I've introduced to you the 
basic planning problem which is the 

4
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:17,742
problem we are addressing in this course. 
I've also told you about a technique that 

5
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:22,547
is used in many places in AI but 
specifically it's very important to 

6
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:27,750
planning and that technique is search. 
Then we've met some of our friends the 

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,019
duck worker robots an example we will be 
using throughout the course. 

8
00:00:32,019 --> 00:00:37,104
This was followed by my colleague Austin 
Tate telling you about practical planners 

9
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:41,874
and applications where these are used. 
But planning is not just about finding 

10
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:46,601
plans there is also a context to planning 
and this is for example what happens 

11
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:50,508
before a planning mainly the assignment 
of tasks to Planners. 

12
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:54,264
And after planning, the plan execution 
which is very important. 

13
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:58,504
Then, we've also seen that there is a 
range of techniques that are used in 

14
00:00:58,504 --> 00:01:01,762
planners today. 
That was pretty much what we've learned 

15
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,672
in Week 1. 
And now I want to talk a little bit about 

16
00:01:04,672 --> 00:01:07,724
the website. 
I've already seen a lot of you have used 

17
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:11,939
the social platform that comes with this 
course, which you can see here. 

18
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,612
And I would like to encourage you to use 
the discussion forums. 

19
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:20,044
To bring up any questions, any issues, 
that you have with the course material 

20
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:24,728
and hopefully some of the the community 
that uses this forum will answer those 

21
00:01:24,728 --> 00:01:28,322
questions for you or we, the instructors, 
can help as well. 

22
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:34,767
In this week's first segment we'll be 
looking at informed search or more 

23
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:41,645
specifically the A* search algorithm. 
A* is a search algorithm just like the 

24
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:47,580
ones we've seen last week. 
It takes an implicit graph and searches 

25
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:53,440
it in its basic form as a tree. 
Shown here is the search tree generated 

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,457
by the A* algorithm for the touring 
Romania problem where the task is to get 

27
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:04,539
from Arad to Bucharest. 
What is new here, is that the algorithm 

28
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:10,672
uses a number to guide its search, and 
this number expresses how far from the 

29
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:15,017
search node the algorithm thinks the 
current node is. 

30
00:02:15,017 --> 00:02:19,979
This is called a heuristic. 
And this heuristic is used to compute 

31
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:25,634
some evaluation function that tells the 
algorithm which node to expand next. 

32
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:31,200
In this graph, we see the numbers here 
which are the value of this evaluation 

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,755
function. 
So, what this algorithm does is use an 

34
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:40,631
informed search strategy, as opposed to 
the uninformed search strategies we've 

35
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:44,599
seen so far. 
And probably the best known informed 

36
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:50,567
search strategy in the A start algorithm 
which is what we will see in the first 

37
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:55,130
segment this week. 
In this week's second segment we will be 

38
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:00,752
seeing our first planning algorithm which 
is the forward state space. 

39
00:03:00,752 --> 00:03:04,577
Search/g algorithm. 
This uses the search technology we've 

40
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:09,200
seen in the previous segment. 
As you will see in detail, this algorithm 

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,269
is actually very simple. 
It takes a planning problem as input, 

42
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:16,230
which is these three components you see 
here. 

43
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,094
And then starts a loop where it starts 
from the initial state and builds up a 

44
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:25,137
plan starting from an empty plan. 
That will satisfy the goal. 

45
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:29,617
The first thing it does is the goal test, 
which is just what we've seen in our 

46
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:32,492
search algorithm. 
So this is the goal test here. 

47
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:36,497
And then generates all the applicable 
actions in the current state. 

48
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:39,397
If there are none, then of course we have 
failed. 

49
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:42,767
Otherwise it just chooses one of the 
applicable actions. 

50
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:45,667
That is our new action that we apply in 
our state. 

51
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:49,762
Then we go to a new state by going 
forward from our current state. 

52
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,723
And extend our plan with this current 
action. 

53
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:56,842
And we go through this loop, until we 
have reached a goal state. 

54
00:03:56,842 --> 00:04:00,598
And therefore we have found a plan that 
achieves our goal. 

55
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:05,462
But before we get to this algorithm, we 
will see a formal definition of what 

56
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:10,467
constitutes a planning problem. 
And most importantly we will see the 

57
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:16,713
scripts representation for operators, 
which is the set O here, which describes 

58
00:04:16,713 --> 00:04:21,979
an operator as something consisting of 
preconditions and effects. 

59
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:25,397
That's what we will look at later this 
week. 

60
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:29,592
So now it's time to get into the material 
for week 2. 

61
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:33,256
Week 1 was fairly lightweight, and you've 
seen an informal introduction to 

62
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:35,754
planning. 
In Week 2, we will see the material a lot 

63
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:38,442
more technical. 
We will introduce algorithms, and you 

64
00:04:38,442 --> 00:04:40,669
will have something to implement, if you 
want.
