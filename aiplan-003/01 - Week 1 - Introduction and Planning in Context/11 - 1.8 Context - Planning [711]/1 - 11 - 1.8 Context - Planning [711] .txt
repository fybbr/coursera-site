We'll take a look at the very wide range 
of planning research areas and 
techniques. 
There's been quite a lot of work in 
domain modeling, domain description, and 
domain analysis, prior to using these 
descriptions, these domain descriptions 
in planners themselves. 
Then of course the core work in AI 
planning is being in the search methods, 
and algorithms for creating plans, 
searching for plans. 
People have looked up plan analysis 
because if you can constrain the types of 
plan you're interested in through 
analysis, that can limit the search 
spaces involved. 
It could be useful to pause here and to 
read through this list of areas and 
techniques. 
How many have you already heard of? 
Check out or ask about any acronym you 
don't know. 
Continue on when you're ready. 
Then people concerned with realistic and 
practical planning problems have often 
had to deal with the hue of repairing 
plans when things go wrong or when the 
circumstances change. 
A number of people have looked at planned 
generalization, 
the reuse of generalized plan fragments. 
The sport of the user involved in 
planning via a suitable user interface 
is, advice interfaces and the ability to 
generate plans in a mixed issued fashion 
between the automated system and the 
human are important. 
In recent years, planners have been made 
available as web services in order that 
they can be used as a component of larger 
scale systems. 
And plans can be used in a range of other 
areas, such as natural language 
generation, dialogue management, the 
sharing of plans between humans and so 
on. 
Pause again, to look at the research 
areas and techniques listed. 
So as you can see here, we're dealing 
with the whole life-cycle plans, right 
through from, creating domain models, 
to making use of those plans in 
productive situations. 
The problem is that we need to make sense 
of all of this. 
We need to find a way of fitting in the 
very many techniques that are available 
now and that will become available 
through further research and development. 
What's needed is more collaborative 
planning framework. 
At the alta level, we've got to be able 
to relate to the humans involved in the 
planning process, 
where they can present their objectives, 
their issues, 
they can make sense of the situation. 
They can give multiple options and 
advice. 
They can argue about those options, 
discuss them, outline plans, and so on. 
Then we want detailed planners, search 
engines, constraints, all that analyzers 
and simulators, that can act within that 
outdoor frame, and work in an 
understandable way, 
and use it to provide feasibility checks, 
detailed constraints, and guidance. 
Want to be able to share processes and 
information about process products 
between humans and systems, 
and want to look at the current status, 
the context we're in, the environment 
we're in, you know, to be sensitive to 
that. 
We need a link between informal and 
unstructured planning and more structured 
planning and methods for optimization. 
And that's what we've been trying to do 
with our I X I plan work, just as an 
example of how some of this integration 
is going on in practical A I planning 
systems. 
First of all, we base it on an 
underlying, intelligible, easily 
communicated, easily extended, conceptual 
model for objectives, processes, 
procedures and plans. 
Just based on four components, a set of 
issues to be addressed, a set of nodes, 
which are activities to be included in 
the plan, a set of constraints which have 
got to be respected and a set of 
annotations on the entities that are 
involved there. 
We call that model INCA. 
Then we want to communicate the dynamic 
status and presence of the agents 
involved. 
The collaborative processes that process 
products, and what they, what they're 
able to do in terms of their 
capabilities. 
Want to be sensitive to the current 
context so the presentation of options 
for action are those which are suitable 
for the context we're in. 
And we want to do intelligent activity 
planning, execution and monitoring 
repair, and plan repair, and we do that 
via the iPlan planner and what we call 
the IX process panels, which are the user 
interface element in the IX technology. 
So IXs aim is a planning workflow and 
task messaging catch all. 
We designed it in order that it can deal 
with the wide range of problems that can 
be addressed in planning and activity 
management. 
It's meant to be able to take any 
requirement to handle an issue, 
perform an activity, 
respect a constraint, or note an 
annotation. 
So that's the underlying computational 
model of the I-X platform. 
They can deal with these by a manual 
activity, 
so you can basically, just take items 
off, for instance, on checklist. 
That's a perfectly good way of 
representing the fact that you've 
performed an activity in some systems. 
But also, by inbuilt internal 
capabilities in the system, 
by external capabilities you know about, 
or by rerouting or delegating to other 
panels and agents, which is where 
communication and collaboration and the 
models of those, those other agents comes 
in. 
And all we can plan next year to 
compensate to these capabilities and we 
can use the planner inside the system 
itself, to plan that kind of work flow. 
And then the system receives reports and 
interprets them to understand the current 
state it's in, 
and to be able to start to handle that 
situation and help the user control the 
situation. 
And the idea is it can cope with just 
partial knowledge of the process and 
organization involved, 
and be able to fit in to an environment 
where it isn't the only agent that's 
working on plans and processes within an 
organization. 
I-x, as we've said before, has been 
applied to emerge in serious bonds, and 
we've used this kind of process panel or 
user interface that's what the task. 
But it's in a context where there is a 
lot of verbal tools. 
The main editors, links to mapping tools, 
the planner itself can have a pop up 
window, its like you look at the options 
its generating and guide them and give 
them advice and so on and you can link to 
messaging and communication tools to the 
systems. 
So that concludes this series of 
presentations on AI planning and context. 
We've been looking at the context of 
practical systems, and we've shown you 
some practical planners in use. 
We've looked at the context of task 
assignment, and execution, the fact that 
we're often working with multiple agents, 
multiple systems and multiple services, 
and we've looked at the context of 
planned representation itself, where rich 
plan representations can be used for many 
kinds of communication and collaboration 
in activity and, and planning situations. 
And finally, we looked at Planning++, to 
try to make sense of the wide range of 
techniques being developed in this field, 
and looked at a model for bringing some 
of these techniques together in a 
productive way.
