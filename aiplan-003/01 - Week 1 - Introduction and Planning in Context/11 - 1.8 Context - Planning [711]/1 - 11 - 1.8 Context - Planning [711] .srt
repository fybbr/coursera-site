1
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,141
We'll take a look at the very wide range 
of planning research areas and 

2
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,092
techniques. 
There's been quite a lot of work in 

3
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:23,865
domain modeling, domain description, and 
domain analysis, prior to using these 

4
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:27,759
descriptions, these domain descriptions 
in planners themselves. 

5
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:32,468
Then of course the core work in AI 
planning is being in the search methods, 

6
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:35,860
and algorithms for creating plans, 
searching for plans. 

7
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,085
People have looked up plan analysis 
because if you can constrain the types of 

8
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:45,708
plan you're interested in through 
analysis, that can limit the search 

9
00:00:45,708 --> 00:00:49,112
spaces involved. 
It could be useful to pause here and to 

10
00:00:49,112 --> 00:00:51,853
read through this list of areas and 
techniques. 

11
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:56,169
How many have you already heard of? 
Check out or ask about any acronym you 

12
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:58,560
don't know. 
Continue on when you're ready. 

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,429
Then people concerned with realistic and 
practical planning problems have often 

14
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:12,385
had to deal with the hue of repairing 
plans when things go wrong or when the 

15
00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:16,440
circumstances change. 
A number of people have looked at planned 

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,980
generalization, 
the reuse of generalized plan fragments. 

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,655
The sport of the user involved in 
planning via a suitable user interface 

18
00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:31,688
is, advice interfaces and the ability to 
generate plans in a mixed issued fashion 

19
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:35,229
between the automated system and the 
human are important. 

20
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:40,200
In recent years, planners have been made 
available as web services in order that 

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,200
they can be used as a component of larger 
scale systems. 

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,450
And plans can be used in a range of other 
areas, such as natural language 

23
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,758
generation, dialogue management, the 
sharing of plans between humans and so 

24
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:55,029
on. 
Pause again, to look at the research 

25
00:01:55,029 --> 00:02:01,585
areas and techniques listed. 
So as you can see here, we're dealing 

26
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:06,195
with the whole life-cycle plans, right 
through from, creating domain models, 

27
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:10,100
to making use of those plans in 
productive situations. 

28
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,893
The problem is that we need to make sense 
of all of this. 

29
00:02:12,893 --> 00:02:16,814
We need to find a way of fitting in the 
very many techniques that are available 

30
00:02:16,814 --> 00:02:21,380
now and that will become available 
through further research and development. 

31
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,800
What's needed is more collaborative 
planning framework. 

32
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,137
At the alta level, we've got to be able 
to relate to the humans involved in the 

33
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:33,267
planning process, 
where they can present their objectives, 

34
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:36,012
their issues, 
they can make sense of the situation. 

35
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:38,318
They can give multiple options and 
advice. 

36
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:42,272
They can argue about those options, 
discuss them, outline plans, and so on. 

37
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:46,555
Then we want detailed planners, search 
engines, constraints, all that analyzers 

38
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:50,288
and simulators, that can act within that 
outdoor frame, and work in an 

39
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:53,583
understandable way, 
and use it to provide feasibility checks, 

40
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:57,656
detailed constraints, and guidance. 
Want to be able to share processes and 

41
00:02:57,656 --> 00:03:01,164
information about process products 
between humans and systems, 

42
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:05,463
and want to look at the current status, 
the context we're in, the environment 

43
00:03:05,463 --> 00:03:08,340
we're in, you know, to be sensitive to 
that. 

44
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,554
We need a link between informal and 
unstructured planning and more structured 

45
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:16,768
planning and methods for optimization. 
And that's what we've been trying to do 

46
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:20,874
with our I X I plan work, just as an 
example of how some of this integration 

47
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:23,360
is going on in practical A I planning 
systems. 

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,062
First of all, we base it on an 
underlying, intelligible, easily 

49
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:34,024
communicated, easily extended, conceptual 
model for objectives, processes, 

50
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:38,217
procedures and plans. 
Just based on four components, a set of 

51
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:43,597
issues to be addressed, a set of nodes, 
which are activities to be included in 

52
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:48,769
the plan, a set of constraints which have 
got to be respected and a set of 

53
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:52,402
annotations on the entities that are 
involved there. 

54
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:57,215
We call that model INCA. 
Then we want to communicate the dynamic 

55
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:59,684
status and presence of the agents 
involved. 

56
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:04,103
The collaborative processes that process 
products, and what they, what they're 

57
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:06,514
able to do in terms of their 
capabilities. 

58
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:10,819
Want to be sensitive to the current 
context so the presentation of options 

59
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,550
for action are those which are suitable 
for the context we're in. 

60
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,117
And we want to do intelligent activity 
planning, execution and monitoring 

61
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:23,934
repair, and plan repair, and we do that 
via the iPlan planner and what we call 

62
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:28,940
the IX process panels, which are the user 
interface element in the IX technology. 

63
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,279
So IXs aim is a planning workflow and 
task messaging catch all. 

64
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:39,095
We designed it in order that it can deal 
with the wide range of problems that can 

65
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:41,972
be addressed in planning and activity 
management. 

66
00:04:41,972 --> 00:04:45,789
It's meant to be able to take any 
requirement to handle an issue, 

67
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:48,843
perform an activity, 
respect a constraint, or note an 

68
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:51,838
annotation. 
So that's the underlying computational 

69
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:56,461
model of the I-X platform. 
They can deal with these by a manual 

70
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:59,248
activity, 
so you can basically, just take items 

71
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:02,520
off, for instance, on checklist. 
That's a perfectly good way of 

72
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,883
representing the fact that you've 
performed an activity in some systems. 

73
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:10,276
But also, by inbuilt internal 
capabilities in the system, 

74
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:14,980
by external capabilities you know about, 
or by rerouting or delegating to other 

75
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,247
panels and agents, which is where 
communication and collaboration and the 

76
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:21,469
models of those, those other agents comes 
in. 

77
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:25,736
And all we can plan next year to 
compensate to these capabilities and we 

78
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:30,180
can use the planner inside the system 
itself, to plan that kind of work flow. 

79
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,723
And then the system receives reports and 
interprets them to understand the current 

80
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:39,880
state it's in, 
and to be able to start to handle that 

81
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,859
situation and help the user control the 
situation. 

82
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:47,326
And the idea is it can cope with just 
partial knowledge of the process and 

83
00:05:47,326 --> 00:05:51,019
organization involved, 
and be able to fit in to an environment 

84
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:55,665
where it isn't the only agent that's 
working on plans and processes within an 

85
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:59,774
organization. 
I-x, as we've said before, has been 

86
00:05:59,774 --> 00:06:04,018
applied to emerge in serious bonds, and 
we've used this kind of process panel or 

87
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:07,481
user interface that's what the task. 
But it's in a context where there is a 

88
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:10,832
lot of verbal tools. 
The main editors, links to mapping tools, 

89
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:15,132
the planner itself can have a pop up 
window, its like you look at the options 

90
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:19,823
its generating and guide them and give 
them advice and so on and you can link to 

91
00:06:19,823 --> 00:06:22,560
messaging and communication tools to the 
systems. 

92
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,235
So that concludes this series of 
presentations on AI planning and context. 

93
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:32,629
We've been looking at the context of 
practical systems, and we've shown you 

94
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:36,554
some practical planners in use. 
We've looked at the context of task 

95
00:06:36,554 --> 00:06:41,241
assignment, and execution, the fact that 
we're often working with multiple agents, 

96
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:45,577
multiple systems and multiple services, 
and we've looked at the context of 

97
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:50,264
planned representation itself, where rich 
plan representations can be used for many 

98
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:55,010
kinds of communication and collaboration 
in activity and, and planning situations. 

99
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:59,616
And finally, we looked at Planning++, to 
try to make sense of the wide range of 

100
00:06:59,616 --> 00:07:03,955
techniques being developed in this field, 
and looked at a model for bringing some 

101
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:06,580
of these techniques together in a 
productive way.
