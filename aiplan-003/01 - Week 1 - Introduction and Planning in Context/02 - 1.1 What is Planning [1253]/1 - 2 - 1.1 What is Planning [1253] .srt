1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,236
This is the first segment of the 
artificial intelligence planning course. 

2
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:13,918
In this segment I will give you an 
introduction and overview to the problem 

3
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:16,752
we are addressing in the field of A.I. 
planning. 

4
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:21,434
This will include some examples and 
introduction to the basic techniques we 

5
00:00:21,434 --> 00:00:27,208
will be using to solve planning problems. 
So the first question I have to answer 

6
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:31,423
is, what is planning?" And more 
specifically, what do we mean by planning 

7
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:35,097
in the context of artificial 
intelligence?" I will answer this 

8
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:39,794
question by informally describing the 
planning problem that is the problem we 

9
00:00:39,794 --> 00:00:44,130
are trying to solve in this field. 
I will then argue why this problem is 

10
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,081
important for artificial intelligence as 
a whole. 

11
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:51,477
And then continue to describe some 
techniques that will be used to solve 

12
00:00:51,477 --> 00:00:56,290
this problem. 
So let us start by looking at human 

13
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,320
planning and acting. 
Humans rarely plan before acting in 

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,493
everyday situations. 
Ask yourself, when was the last time I 

15
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:10,322
sat down and made a plan before acting? 
Chances are this will have been some time 

16
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:13,993
ago. 
This is because humans act without prior 

17
00:01:13,993 --> 00:01:19,204
explicit planning quite often. 
There's a number of situations where this 

18
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:23,892
is the case and here are some examples. 
When the purpose of my action is 

19
00:01:23,892 --> 00:01:28,450
immediate, I don't need to make an 
explicit plan. For example, to record 

20
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,399
this lecture, I needed to switch on this 
computer. I know how to do this, so I 

21
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,720
just did it. 
I didn't need to make an explicit plan. 

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,449
The purpose of the action was immediate. 
When performing well-trained behaviors, I 

23
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:45,829
also don't need to do explicit planning. 
For me, this would be driving a car. 

24
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:49,507
I know how to drive a car. 
I've done this many times, so I don't 

25
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:54,062
need to make a plan before I switch gears 
or before I turn the steering wheel. 

26
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:56,981
It's a well-trained behavior, 
I don't need to plan. 

27
00:01:56,981 --> 00:02:01,302
When the course of action can be freely 
adapted, I also don't need to plan. 

28
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:04,222
This would be when I go shopping in the 
supermarket. 

29
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:08,310
I don't need to plan in which order I go 
through the different aisles, 

30
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,535
because I can always adapt my my acting 
to what I've missed in previous aisles 

31
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:18,370
and just go there again. 
So the, the course of action can be 

32
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,100
freely adapted, means I don't need to 
plan. 

33
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,780
A number of situations make it possible 
to plan, though, 

34
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,880
and here are some examples where planning 
is necessary, 

35
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,543
that is explicit planning. 
So, when I'm addressing a new situation, 

36
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:35,869
something that I haven't done before or 
haven't done often, 

37
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:39,983
then I need to do explicit planning. 
An example of this would be moving a 

38
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:42,520
house. 
Everybody who has done a big move with, 

39
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,352
with furniture will know what this means. 
You need to organize a van. 

40
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:50,016
You need to organize people. 
You need to have an explicit plan in 

41
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:54,407
place before you can successfully move 
from one place to another. 

42
00:02:54,407 --> 00:03:00,240
another situation is when the task you're 
trying to achieve is very complex. 

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,083
So, for example, when I was planning this 
course, I was doing explissive planning. 

44
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:11,033
This is quite a complex task, it involve 
ten hours of lecturing and many other 

45
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,940
things, so explicit planning was 
necessary. 

46
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,113
Another type of situation where acting 
happens only after planning is when the 

47
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:23,168
environment imposes a high risk or a high 
cost. 

48
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:28,171
So if I'm the manager of a nuclear power 
station, I will do a lot of planning 

49
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:33,500
before I act, because it's very important 
what I do and the potential damage I can 

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,580
do with wrong action is high. 
So, 

51
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,572
I will do explicit planning to counteract 
that. 

52
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:43,348
Also, when I'm collaborating with others, 
explicit planning can be extremely 

53
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,213
helpful. 
So, think of people who are trying to 

54
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:49,397
build a house. 
That's the people who are trying to put 

55
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:53,472
up the walls, trying to put in the 
plumbing, and of, the electricians. 

56
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:58,248
They all need to coordinate their 
activity and that means they all need to 

57
00:03:58,248 --> 00:04:03,060
have an explicit plan for when they do 
what and in which order. 

58
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,446
So the main lesson here is that people 
only plan when it's strictly necessary. 

59
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:11,415
We don't do planning when we don't have 
to. 

60
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:14,868
We only plan when we feel there's a 
benefit to it. 

61
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:19,909
And this is because planning is a 
complicated and time-consuming process. 

62
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:24,742
There is a basic trade-off here. 
If we plan, we normally come up with a 

63
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:27,919
course of action that leads to better 
results, 

64
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,062
but there is a cost. 
So, if there is no benefit to be had from 

65
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:35,170
planning, we're often better off not 
planning. 

66
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:42,388
That is, often we seek only solutions or 
plans that are good enough for what we 

67
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:49,606
are trying to achieve, not optimal plans. 
So people only plan when it's strictly 

68
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:54,914
necessary. 
Here is the definition for what we mean 

69
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:59,896
by artificial intelligence planning. 
Let me read this out for you first. 

70
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:05,250
Planning is an explicit deliberation 
process that chooses and organizes 

71
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,222
actions by anticipating their outcomes 
and that aims at achieving some 

72
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:14,304
pre-stated objectives. 
So I will try to take this apart for you 

73
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:16,765
now. 
What this says is, planning is an 

74
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:21,170
explicit deliberation process. 
What this means is, to plan, we need to 

75
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,956
think. 
It's a mental process where we think 

76
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,742
about the actions that we are trying to 
do. 

77
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:30,952
It also needs to be explicit thinking, 
which means, it's conscious. 

78
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:34,062
It's not a subconscious process that's 
going on, 

79
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:38,596
we are aware that we are doing this 
planning so we are thinking about 

80
00:05:38,596 --> 00:05:41,895
planning. 
In this thought process, we choose and 

81
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:45,896
organize actions. 
So, choosing means, we have some options 

82
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:48,968
available, things that we may be able to 
do. 

83
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:54,184
And we choose some of these actions, and 
we discard others, as part of the 

84
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:58,113
planning process. 
We also organize these actions into a 

85
00:05:58,113 --> 00:05:59,400
structure. 
That is, 

86
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,255
we could choose which actions to do 
before which other action, 

87
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:07,795
which actions to do in parallel, 
what the outcomes of each action will be, 

88
00:06:07,795 --> 00:06:10,843
etcetera. 
So we organize them into some structure. 

89
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:14,699
And, the way we do this is by 
anticipating the outcomes of the 

90
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:17,933
different actions that we have available 
as options. 

91
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:22,100
So we think about, what will the world be 
like if we do this action? 

92
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,318
And the result is either what we want or 
don't want and that's what the next point 

93
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:29,708
is. 
The process aims at achieving some 

94
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:33,669
pre-stated objectives. 
So there are things that we want to have 

95
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:36,373
true in the world, 
these are our objectives, 

96
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:41,654
and by anticipating the outcomes, we can 
compare the world states as they will be 

97
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:47,625
when we execute an action to the ones in 
which the objectives we try to achieve 

98
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:51,358
are satisfied. 
So that is what we mean by planning. 

99
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:56,732
Planning is an explicit deliberation 
process that chooses and organizes 

100
00:06:56,732 --> 00:07:02,032
actions by anticipating their outcomes 
and that aims at achieving some 

101
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:06,471
pre-stated objectives. 
Artificial intelligence planning now is 

102
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:09,931
the computational study of this 
deliberation process. 

103
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:14,893
So what we're interested in is the 
thinking about plans, the reasoning about 

104
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:19,789
actions that takes place when we are 
planning and we are trying to build a 

105
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:25,491
computational model of this process. 
Now that I've defined what we mean by 

106
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:28,622
planning, 
I want to explain to you why it is so 

107
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:32,286
important to study planning in artificial 
intelligence. 

108
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:35,883
The goal of artificial intelligence is 
really twofold, 

109
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:39,214
there's a scientific goal and an 
engineering goal. 

110
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:42,945
The scientific goal of A.I. 
is to understand intelligence, 

111
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:47,741
and the key observation here is, that 
planning is an important aspect of 

112
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:51,405
intelligent behavior. 
So, if we observe some intelligent 

113
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:56,718
behavior, we assume that there is an 
underlying plan and we assume that this 

114
00:07:56,718 --> 00:08:02,147
plan is the result of some planning. 
So, to understand intelligence, we need 

115
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:05,853
to understand planning, which is part of 
intelligence. 

116
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:11,237
In that sense, understanding planning 
directly contributes to the scientific 

117
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:13,684
goal of A.I.. 
The other goal of A.I. 

118
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:18,090
is the engineering goal, which is to 
build intelligent entities, 

119
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,075
that is we want to build robots or other 
entities that exhibit intelligent 

120
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:26,265
behavior. 
And if this is to be intelligent to us, 

121
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:31,516
this needs to involve actions that are 
carefully chosen and organized as we do 

122
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:34,840
in planning. 
So what we do in planning is we build 

123
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,958
models of how this planning works and 
these models are software models, so we 

124
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,880
can build them into our intelligent 
entities as components. 

125
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,820
So planning directly also contributes to 
the engineering goal of A.I. 

126
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,663
And just as a side remark, the robot you 
see here is the Shakey robot that was 

127
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:58,695
built in the late 60s and that was one of 
the first robots that used an actual 

128
00:08:58,695 --> 00:09:04,710
planner to come up with its actions. 
There are really two different types of 

129
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,202
planning, domain-specific and 
domain-independent planning. 

130
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:12,796
In domain-specific planning, we use 
specific representations and techniques 

131
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:16,227
that are adapted to each problem we are 
trying to solve. 

132
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:20,760
There are a number of important examples 
for this type of planning, 

133
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,130
domain-specific planning, 
for example, path and motion planning. 

134
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,930
If we are trying to navigate a robot 
through a two-dimensional or 

135
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,784
three-dimensional space, we need to come 
up with a path through that space, that 

136
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,107
gets the robot from one location to 
another. 

137
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:38,224
And to do so, a number of algorithms have 
been developed to, to make sure that the 

138
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:42,131
robot doesn't bump into other objects or 
will fit through narrow passages. 

139
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:46,683
All these algorithms are highly specific 
and very efficient. 

140
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:51,976
Another example is perception planning. 
If we try to understand a given situation 

141
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:57,011
a robot may have to wander around in a 
scene and observe different aspects of 

142
00:09:57,011 --> 00:10:00,110
different angles to understand what is 
going on. 

143
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,682
And again, there are highly specific 
algorithms that have been developed for 

144
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:08,232
this type of problem. 
Manipulation planning is another such 

145
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:12,443
problem where we are trying to, for 
example, assemble an object from 

146
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:17,016
different parts and that needs to happen 
in a specific order for it to work. 

147
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:21,889
also, natural language generation uses 
highly specific algorithms for planning, 

148
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,740
namely the planning of utterances that 
lead to communicating, 

149
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,525
as given subject. The point is in all 
these domains, we have specific 

150
00:10:30,525 --> 00:10:34,960
algorithms that we use to efficiently 
solve a specific problem. 

151
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,517
On the other hand, there's 
domain-independent planning. 

152
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:43,590
And there, we use generic representations 
and techniques to solve the generic 

153
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,037
planning problem. 
The advantage of this is that it saves 

154
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:49,723
effort, 
so we don't need to reinvent the same 

155
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:52,528
techniques for different problems all the 
time. 

156
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:55,453
We can always reuse the same planning 
algorithms. 

157
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:59,870
The disadvantage is that, this means 
planning from first principles and is 

158
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,033
often relatively slow, 
but it also leads to a general 

159
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:07,510
understanding of planning and as I've 
just explained, that's the scientific 

160
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,826
goal of artificial intelligence. 
The important lesson here is that 

161
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:15,230
domain-independent planning complements 
domain-specific planning. 

162
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,808
Domain-specific planning is good for 
specific problems where highly efficient 

163
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:23,623
solutions are required. 
Domain-independent planning is good if we 

164
00:11:23,623 --> 00:11:28,084
need to plan from first principles for 
the type of situation I've explained 

165
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:30,960
earlier, 
situations we have never seen before for 

166
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,777
example. 
So the two types of planning complement 

167
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,536
each other. 
But in this course, we will focus on 

168
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:39,060
techniques for domain-independent 
planning. 

169
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,911
So here's a little quiz to test your 
understanding so far. 

170
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:47,298
The following five statements are either 
true or false. 

171
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:50,500
Please tick the box for the statements 
that are true. 

172
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,631
The first statement, people only plan 
when they have to because the benefit of 

173
00:11:56,631 --> 00:12:00,710
an optimal plan does not justify the 
effort of planning is true. 

174
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:06,310
The second statement for humans planning 
as a subconscious process, which is why 

175
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,624
computational planning so hard is false. 
The reason is that planning is not a 

176
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:15,522
subconscious process. 
We have defined planning as the explicit 

177
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:18,603
deliberation process, so it needs to be 
conscious. 

178
00:12:18,603 --> 00:12:23,381
Third statement, planning involves a 
mental simulation of actions to foresee 

179
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:26,273
future world states and compare them to 
goals, 

180
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:29,725
that statement is true. 
fourth statement, in artificial 

181
00:12:29,725 --> 00:12:34,252
intelligence, planning is concerned with 
the search for computationally optimal 

182
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:35,971
plans, 
that statement is false. 

183
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:40,153
We're not only after optimal plans, 
we also want to sometimes find out 

184
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:43,420
whether a plan exists at all, whether 
it's optimal or not. 

185
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,205
Finally, domain-specific planning is used 
when efficiency is vital, 

186
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:51,736
whereas domain-independent planning is 
good for planning from first principles. 

187
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,400
That statement is true again.
