This is the first segment of the 
artificial intelligence planning course. 
In this segment I will give you an 
introduction and overview to the problem 
we are addressing in the field of A.I. 
planning. 
This will include some examples and 
introduction to the basic techniques we 
will be using to solve planning problems. 
So the first question I have to answer 
is, what is planning?" And more 
specifically, what do we mean by planning 
in the context of artificial 
intelligence?" I will answer this 
question by informally describing the 
planning problem that is the problem we 
are trying to solve in this field. 
I will then argue why this problem is 
important for artificial intelligence as 
a whole. 
And then continue to describe some 
techniques that will be used to solve 
this problem. 
So let us start by looking at human 
planning and acting. 
Humans rarely plan before acting in 
everyday situations. 
Ask yourself, when was the last time I 
sat down and made a plan before acting? 
Chances are this will have been some time 
ago. 
This is because humans act without prior 
explicit planning quite often. 
There's a number of situations where this 
is the case and here are some examples. 
When the purpose of my action is 
immediate, I don't need to make an 
explicit plan. For example, to record 
this lecture, I needed to switch on this 
computer. I know how to do this, so I 
just did it. 
I didn't need to make an explicit plan. 
The purpose of the action was immediate. 
When performing well-trained behaviors, I 
also don't need to do explicit planning. 
For me, this would be driving a car. 
I know how to drive a car. 
I've done this many times, so I don't 
need to make a plan before I switch gears 
or before I turn the steering wheel. 
It's a well-trained behavior, 
I don't need to plan. 
When the course of action can be freely 
adapted, I also don't need to plan. 
This would be when I go shopping in the 
supermarket. 
I don't need to plan in which order I go 
through the different aisles, 
because I can always adapt my my acting 
to what I've missed in previous aisles 
and just go there again. 
So the, the course of action can be 
freely adapted, means I don't need to 
plan. 
A number of situations make it possible 
to plan, though, 
and here are some examples where planning 
is necessary, 
that is explicit planning. 
So, when I'm addressing a new situation, 
something that I haven't done before or 
haven't done often, 
then I need to do explicit planning. 
An example of this would be moving a 
house. 
Everybody who has done a big move with, 
with furniture will know what this means. 
You need to organize a van. 
You need to organize people. 
You need to have an explicit plan in 
place before you can successfully move 
from one place to another. 
another situation is when the task you're 
trying to achieve is very complex. 
So, for example, when I was planning this 
course, I was doing explissive planning. 
This is quite a complex task, it involve 
ten hours of lecturing and many other 
things, so explicit planning was 
necessary. 
Another type of situation where acting 
happens only after planning is when the 
environment imposes a high risk or a high 
cost. 
So if I'm the manager of a nuclear power 
station, I will do a lot of planning 
before I act, because it's very important 
what I do and the potential damage I can 
do with wrong action is high. 
So, 
I will do explicit planning to counteract 
that. 
Also, when I'm collaborating with others, 
explicit planning can be extremely 
helpful. 
So, think of people who are trying to 
build a house. 
That's the people who are trying to put 
up the walls, trying to put in the 
plumbing, and of, the electricians. 
They all need to coordinate their 
activity and that means they all need to 
have an explicit plan for when they do 
what and in which order. 
So the main lesson here is that people 
only plan when it's strictly necessary. 
We don't do planning when we don't have 
to. 
We only plan when we feel there's a 
benefit to it. 
And this is because planning is a 
complicated and time-consuming process. 
There is a basic trade-off here. 
If we plan, we normally come up with a 
course of action that leads to better 
results, 
but there is a cost. 
So, if there is no benefit to be had from 
planning, we're often better off not 
planning. 
That is, often we seek only solutions or 
plans that are good enough for what we 
are trying to achieve, not optimal plans. 
So people only plan when it's strictly 
necessary. 
Here is the definition for what we mean 
by artificial intelligence planning. 
Let me read this out for you first. 
Planning is an explicit deliberation 
process that chooses and organizes 
actions by anticipating their outcomes 
and that aims at achieving some 
pre-stated objectives. 
So I will try to take this apart for you 
now. 
What this says is, planning is an 
explicit deliberation process. 
What this means is, to plan, we need to 
think. 
It's a mental process where we think 
about the actions that we are trying to 
do. 
It also needs to be explicit thinking, 
which means, it's conscious. 
It's not a subconscious process that's 
going on, 
we are aware that we are doing this 
planning so we are thinking about 
planning. 
In this thought process, we choose and 
organize actions. 
So, choosing means, we have some options 
available, things that we may be able to 
do. 
And we choose some of these actions, and 
we discard others, as part of the 
planning process. 
We also organize these actions into a 
structure. 
That is, 
we could choose which actions to do 
before which other action, 
which actions to do in parallel, 
what the outcomes of each action will be, 
etcetera. 
So we organize them into some structure. 
And, the way we do this is by 
anticipating the outcomes of the 
different actions that we have available 
as options. 
So we think about, what will the world be 
like if we do this action? 
And the result is either what we want or 
don't want and that's what the next point 
is. 
The process aims at achieving some 
pre-stated objectives. 
So there are things that we want to have 
true in the world, 
these are our objectives, 
and by anticipating the outcomes, we can 
compare the world states as they will be 
when we execute an action to the ones in 
which the objectives we try to achieve 
are satisfied. 
So that is what we mean by planning. 
Planning is an explicit deliberation 
process that chooses and organizes 
actions by anticipating their outcomes 
and that aims at achieving some 
pre-stated objectives. 
Artificial intelligence planning now is 
the computational study of this 
deliberation process. 
So what we're interested in is the 
thinking about plans, the reasoning about 
actions that takes place when we are 
planning and we are trying to build a 
computational model of this process. 
Now that I've defined what we mean by 
planning, 
I want to explain to you why it is so 
important to study planning in artificial 
intelligence. 
The goal of artificial intelligence is 
really twofold, 
there's a scientific goal and an 
engineering goal. 
The scientific goal of A.I. 
is to understand intelligence, 
and the key observation here is, that 
planning is an important aspect of 
intelligent behavior. 
So, if we observe some intelligent 
behavior, we assume that there is an 
underlying plan and we assume that this 
plan is the result of some planning. 
So, to understand intelligence, we need 
to understand planning, which is part of 
intelligence. 
In that sense, understanding planning 
directly contributes to the scientific 
goal of A.I.. 
The other goal of A.I. 
is the engineering goal, which is to 
build intelligent entities, 
that is we want to build robots or other 
entities that exhibit intelligent 
behavior. 
And if this is to be intelligent to us, 
this needs to involve actions that are 
carefully chosen and organized as we do 
in planning. 
So what we do in planning is we build 
models of how this planning works and 
these models are software models, so we 
can build them into our intelligent 
entities as components. 
So planning directly also contributes to 
the engineering goal of A.I. 
And just as a side remark, the robot you 
see here is the Shakey robot that was 
built in the late 60s and that was one of 
the first robots that used an actual 
planner to come up with its actions. 
There are really two different types of 
planning, domain-specific and 
domain-independent planning. 
In domain-specific planning, we use 
specific representations and techniques 
that are adapted to each problem we are 
trying to solve. 
There are a number of important examples 
for this type of planning, 
domain-specific planning, 
for example, path and motion planning. 
If we are trying to navigate a robot 
through a two-dimensional or 
three-dimensional space, we need to come 
up with a path through that space, that 
gets the robot from one location to 
another. 
And to do so, a number of algorithms have 
been developed to, to make sure that the 
robot doesn't bump into other objects or 
will fit through narrow passages. 
All these algorithms are highly specific 
and very efficient. 
Another example is perception planning. 
If we try to understand a given situation 
a robot may have to wander around in a 
scene and observe different aspects of 
different angles to understand what is 
going on. 
And again, there are highly specific 
algorithms that have been developed for 
this type of problem. 
Manipulation planning is another such 
problem where we are trying to, for 
example, assemble an object from 
different parts and that needs to happen 
in a specific order for it to work. 
also, natural language generation uses 
highly specific algorithms for planning, 
namely the planning of utterances that 
lead to communicating, 
as given subject. The point is in all 
these domains, we have specific 
algorithms that we use to efficiently 
solve a specific problem. 
On the other hand, there's 
domain-independent planning. 
And there, we use generic representations 
and techniques to solve the generic 
planning problem. 
The advantage of this is that it saves 
effort, 
so we don't need to reinvent the same 
techniques for different problems all the 
time. 
We can always reuse the same planning 
algorithms. 
The disadvantage is that, this means 
planning from first principles and is 
often relatively slow, 
but it also leads to a general 
understanding of planning and as I've 
just explained, that's the scientific 
goal of artificial intelligence. 
The important lesson here is that 
domain-independent planning complements 
domain-specific planning. 
Domain-specific planning is good for 
specific problems where highly efficient 
solutions are required. 
Domain-independent planning is good if we 
need to plan from first principles for 
the type of situation I've explained 
earlier, 
situations we have never seen before for 
example. 
So the two types of planning complement 
each other. 
But in this course, we will focus on 
techniques for domain-independent 
planning. 
So here's a little quiz to test your 
understanding so far. 
The following five statements are either 
true or false. 
Please tick the box for the statements 
that are true. 
The first statement, people only plan 
when they have to because the benefit of 
an optimal plan does not justify the 
effort of planning is true. 
The second statement for humans planning 
as a subconscious process, which is why 
computational planning so hard is false. 
The reason is that planning is not a 
subconscious process. 
We have defined planning as the explicit 
deliberation process, so it needs to be 
conscious. 
Third statement, planning involves a 
mental simulation of actions to foresee 
future world states and compare them to 
goals, 
that statement is true. 
fourth statement, in artificial 
intelligence, planning is concerned with 
the search for computationally optimal 
plans, 
that statement is false. 
We're not only after optimal plans, 
we also want to sometimes find out 
whether a plan exists at all, whether 
it's optimal or not. 
Finally, domain-specific planning is used 
when efficiency is vital, 
whereas domain-independent planning is 
good for planning from first principles. 
That statement is true again.
