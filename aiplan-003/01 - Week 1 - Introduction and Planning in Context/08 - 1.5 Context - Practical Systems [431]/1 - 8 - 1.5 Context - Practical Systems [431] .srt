1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,111
This section of the course will look at 
the very wide range of research and 

2
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:14,270
development areas that have been explored 
in AI Planning. 

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,482
It'll put AI Planning techniques in the 
context of domain modeling and plan 

4
00:00:18,482 --> 00:00:21,308
representation. 
Consider engagement with users, task 

5
00:00:21,308 --> 00:00:25,021
assigners, and decision makers, who must 
select between plan options. 

6
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:29,400
And would include the important aspect of 
plan execution for practical systems. 

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,253
The cost logo shows a number of 
applications of [INAUDIBLE] AI planners 

8
00:00:40,253 --> 00:00:43,533
over the years. 
The [INAUDIBLE] planner was used in the 

9
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:48,065
mid 1970s to generate project plans for 
electricity to [INAUDIBLE] overhaul. 

10
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:52,478
The project plans in this case were 
prepared well in advance, because it's 

11
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:55,877
costly to have these machines out for any 
length of time. 

12
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:59,753
But while the repair's taking place 
typically problems are found, 

13
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:02,675
extra maintenance operations need to be 
injected. 

14
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:06,373
so the plans had to be adjusted as you 
went along. 

15
00:01:06,373 --> 00:01:12,277
And [INAUDIBLE] was able to do that. 
In the late 1970's, Steve [INAUDIBLE] at 

16
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:17,250
NASA's jet propulsion laboratory created 
the divisor planner, which was used to 

17
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,586
generate action sequences for the Voyager 
spacecraft. 

18
00:01:20,586 --> 00:01:24,930
Though it wasn't used for uploading live 
action sequences to voyages. 

19
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,951
Divisor was based on the [INAUDIBLE] 
design. 

20
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:32,106
But added the ability to represent time 
windows on the activities. 

21
00:01:32,106 --> 00:01:35,820
Which is important for this kind of 
robotic application. 

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,340
Nonlins hierarchical task network 
approach was also used in some of the 

23
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:49,065
earlier research on the robots in Japan. 
Assembly, integration and tests of the 

24
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:54,316
payload bay for the European Ariane 
rockets was carried out using a planner 

25
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:59,496
based on the O-Plan design. 
O-Plan has also been used in a wide range 

26
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:03,120
of applications in emergency response and 
search and rescue. 

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,422
Edinburgh, AI planners have also been 
used in applications as diverse as help 

28
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:19,313
desks, tanker delivery, and many others. 
Even the earliest AI planners were used 

29
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:24,592
in realistic and practical applications. 
The STRIPS planner from the early 1970s 

30
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:29,054
was used to control the shaky robot. 
And, as you can see from this table, 

31
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:34,018
there's a range of planners over the 
decades which have been applied to a wide 

32
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:38,354
range of application areas. 
And we're going to cover some of those in 

33
00:02:38,354 --> 00:02:43,678
a later module of this course. 
As part of this cause, we're going to 

34
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:46,376
encorage you to look at a number of 
readings. 

35
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:50,873
In particular, there's two reviews of AI 
planning, which we hope you'll find 

36
00:02:50,873 --> 00:02:55,609
useful. One is from the 1990's, so it's 
quite dated, but it does include a lot of 

37
00:02:55,609 --> 00:03:00,466
the work on those early planners and some 
of the formative techniques as used in 

38
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:05,262
them and that you'll learn about in this 
course. And that's the Hendler, Tate in 

39
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:09,280
Drummond paper in AI magazine, on AI 
planning, systems and techniques. 

40
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,177
Is also a review, a decade later, by 
Wilkins and desJardins, on a call for 

41
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:18,871
knowledge-based planning, where 
techniques of knowledge-based systems, 

42
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:24,232
and planning were being brought together. 
Full details of these readings and the 

43
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:28,720
locations where you can find the PDF 
copies of them will be available in the 

44
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,050
cource wiki. 
Then there's a number of readings, 

45
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,171
some of them very short readings. 
on specific planners and their 

46
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:39,246
applications. 
And we hope you might dip into these 

47
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:42,874
during the course. 
If you've got time to read just a couple 

48
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:45,396
of these, these are the ones we'd 
suggest. 

49
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:47,979
The initial review of AI Planners to 
1990. 

50
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:52,591
And a very short paper on O-Plan one of 
the Edinburgh planners, 

51
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:57,450
which looks at a wide range of techniques 
and applications that were in use in 

52
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,578
that, in that system. 
There's a diagram in the 1990 review 

53
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:06,015
paper which tries to trace some of the 
historical connections between the 

54
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:09,612
different planners. 
The techniques they drew on and how they 

55
00:04:09,612 --> 00:04:13,090
build on one another. 
It's worth looking at that in detail. 

56
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,126
Perhaps you could pause the video at this 
point and take a good look at some of the 

57
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:22,443
techniques and areas in there. 
There's an online version of this diagram 

58
00:04:22,443 --> 00:04:27,180
also available at high resolution if you 
can't see it in the video that you're 

59
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,540
using.
