This section of the course will look at 
the very wide range of research and 
development areas that have been explored 
in AI Planning. 
It'll put AI Planning techniques in the 
context of domain modeling and plan 
representation. 
Consider engagement with users, task 
assigners, and decision makers, who must 
select between plan options. 
And would include the important aspect of 
plan execution for practical systems. 
The cost logo shows a number of 
applications of [INAUDIBLE] AI planners 
over the years. 
The [INAUDIBLE] planner was used in the 
mid 1970s to generate project plans for 
electricity to [INAUDIBLE] overhaul. 
The project plans in this case were 
prepared well in advance, because it's 
costly to have these machines out for any 
length of time. 
But while the repair's taking place 
typically problems are found, 
extra maintenance operations need to be 
injected. 
so the plans had to be adjusted as you 
went along. 
And [INAUDIBLE] was able to do that. 
In the late 1970's, Steve [INAUDIBLE] at 
NASA's jet propulsion laboratory created 
the divisor planner, which was used to 
generate action sequences for the Voyager 
spacecraft. 
Though it wasn't used for uploading live 
action sequences to voyages. 
Divisor was based on the [INAUDIBLE] 
design. 
But added the ability to represent time 
windows on the activities. 
Which is important for this kind of 
robotic application. 
Nonlins hierarchical task network 
approach was also used in some of the 
earlier research on the robots in Japan. 
Assembly, integration and tests of the 
payload bay for the European Ariane 
rockets was carried out using a planner 
based on the O-Plan design. 
O-Plan has also been used in a wide range 
of applications in emergency response and 
search and rescue. 
Edinburgh, AI planners have also been 
used in applications as diverse as help 
desks, tanker delivery, and many others. 
Even the earliest AI planners were used 
in realistic and practical applications. 
The STRIPS planner from the early 1970s 
was used to control the shaky robot. 
And, as you can see from this table, 
there's a range of planners over the 
decades which have been applied to a wide 
range of application areas. 
And we're going to cover some of those in 
a later module of this course. 
As part of this cause, we're going to 
encorage you to look at a number of 
readings. 
In particular, there's two reviews of AI 
planning, which we hope you'll find 
useful. One is from the 1990's, so it's 
quite dated, but it does include a lot of 
the work on those early planners and some 
of the formative techniques as used in 
them and that you'll learn about in this 
course. And that's the Hendler, Tate in 
Drummond paper in AI magazine, on AI 
planning, systems and techniques. 
Is also a review, a decade later, by 
Wilkins and desJardins, on a call for 
knowledge-based planning, where 
techniques of knowledge-based systems, 
and planning were being brought together. 
Full details of these readings and the 
locations where you can find the PDF 
copies of them will be available in the 
cource wiki. 
Then there's a number of readings, 
some of them very short readings. 
on specific planners and their 
applications. 
And we hope you might dip into these 
during the course. 
If you've got time to read just a couple 
of these, these are the ones we'd 
suggest. 
The initial review of AI Planners to 
1990. 
And a very short paper on O-Plan one of 
the Edinburgh planners, 
which looks at a wide range of techniques 
and applications that were in use in 
that, in that system. 
There's a diagram in the 1990 review 
paper which tries to trace some of the 
historical connections between the 
different planners. 
The techniques they drew on and how they 
build on one another. 
It's worth looking at that in detail. 
Perhaps you could pause the video at this 
point and take a good look at some of the 
techniques and areas in there. 
There's an online version of this diagram 
also available at high resolution if you 
can't see it in the video that you're 
using.
