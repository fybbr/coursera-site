00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:10,618
Welcome to the course on AI planning. 
Planning is one of the most important 

2
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:14,941
aspects of intelligent behavior. 
The ability to identify and select 

3
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:19,715
appropriate activity, and to project 
forward the consequences of executing 

4
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:24,102
that activity, is fundamental to humans 
and intelligent robots alike. 

5
00:00:24,102 --> 00:00:29,134
The planning course lasts five weeks. 
In the first week of this course, we will 

6
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:34,102
formally define the problem solved by 
planning algorithms and talk about the 

7
00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:38,876
context in which planning is used. 
After that in week two, we will describe 

8
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:43,515
some basic AI techniques used for problem 
solving in general, and planning problems 

9
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:46,006
in particular. 
This will leave you with a good 

10
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:48,334
understanding of the STRIPS planning 
system. 

11
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:52,719
In week three, we will look at different, 
a different approach to the same problem, 

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,238
namely, plan space search. 
In addition, we will cover hierarchical 

13
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:00,244
planning, which addresses a similar 
problem and has been used in many real 

14
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:03,006
world applications. 
Week four gets us closer to the 

15
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:07,229
state-of-the-art in planning research, 
introducing some of the techniques used 

16
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,506
in the fastest planners available today. 
Finally, in week five, we will talk more 

17
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:15,872
about application areas in which they AI 
planning has been used, and some more 

18
00:01:15,872 --> 00:01:18,696
advanced topics. 
The course is going to make use of 

19
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:22,933
lectures on video, supplementary material 
on a wiki, and we'll give you some links 

20
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:26,752
to some AI planners to try, along with 
relevant online resources, and some 

21
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:30,361
recommended quite short readings. 
There'll be a number of quizzes and 

22
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,663
online assessments to monitor your 
progress. 

23
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:36,586
We're going to encourage you to use the 
course social platform, which includes 

24
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:40,509
the discussion forums in the wiki. 
There's going to be a course Twitter tag 

25
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:43,752
and there's also a virtual world meeting 
space for you to try. 

26
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:47,780
Full details of all aspects of the social 
platform are on the course website. 

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,050
We hope you will enjoy the course and 
will learn something useful.
