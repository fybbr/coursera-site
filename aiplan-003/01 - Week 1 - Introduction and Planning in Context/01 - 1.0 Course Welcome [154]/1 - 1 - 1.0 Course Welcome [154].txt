Welcome to the course on AI planning. 
Planning is one of the most important 
aspects of intelligent behavior. 
The ability to identify and select 
appropriate activity, and to project 
forward the consequences of executing 
that activity, is fundamental to humans 
and intelligent robots alike. 
The planning course lasts five weeks. 
In the first week of this course, we will 
formally define the problem solved by 
planning algorithms and talk about the 
context in which planning is used. 
After that in week two, we will describe 
some basic AI techniques used for problem 
solving in general, and planning problems 
in particular. 
This will leave you with a good 
understanding of the STRIPS planning 
system. 
In week three, we will look at different, 
a different approach to the same problem, 
namely, plan space search. 
In addition, we will cover hierarchical 
planning, which addresses a similar 
problem and has been used in many real 
world applications. 
Week four gets us closer to the 
state-of-the-art in planning research, 
introducing some of the techniques used 
in the fastest planners available today. 
Finally, in week five, we will talk more 
about application areas in which they AI 
planning has been used, and some more 
advanced topics. 
The course is going to make use of 
lectures on video, supplementary material 
on a wiki, and we'll give you some links 
to some AI planners to try, along with 
relevant online resources, and some 
recommended quite short readings. 
There'll be a number of quizzes and 
online assessments to monitor your 
progress. 
We're going to encourage you to use the 
course social platform, which includes 
the discussion forums in the wiki. 
There's going to be a course Twitter tag 
and there's also a virtual world meeting 
space for you to try. 
Full details of all aspects of the social 
platform are on the course website. 
We hope you will enjoy the course and 
will learn something useful.
