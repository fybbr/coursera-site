[SOUND] AI Planners, using a generation 
of action sequences in robots such as the 
Freddy 2, Hand/Eye Assembly Robot 
displayed here in the National Museum of 
Scotland in Edinburgh. 
This version of Freddy from four decades 
ago had a large, fixed mounted arm with 
sophisticated touch sensitive grippers, 
and a side mounted camera to look at its 
world. 
Instead of the robot moving to reach 
objects, the platform underneath the 
robot was shifted instead. 
Freddy was demonstrated on flexible 
assembly tasks involving simple toy, 
cars, and boats. 
The video playing is taken from a 16 
millimeter film of a Freddy project 
demonstration made in 1973. 
Freddy had to identify jumbled up parts 
via vision, unscrambled the parts, and 
then assembled them to create the 
required product. 
Some parts in the area didn't belong to 
the target assembly. 
In one project, the Edinburgh, normally 
an AI Planner, was used to generate 
object construction and arm movement 
sequences for Freddy. 
In its time, Freddy was one of the most 
sophisticated robots in the world. 
The Stanford Research Institute Problem 
Solver Strips is one of the best known a 
most influential AI Planners, and you'll 
learn about it on this course. 
Despite of being created over 40 years 
ago, 
it was already news control the activity 
of a robot called Shakey at the Stanford 
Research Institute, which is now call SRI 
International. 
Strips had may interesting features 
including use in theorem proving 
techniques to reason about the state of 
points in the plan. 
Strips gave us a representation of 
actions with preconditions and effects. 
It's got a mechanism called macrobes, for 
generalization of its operators. 
It included execution support facilities 
to deal with partial failures. 
Shakey is now on display at the Computer 
History Museum in Mountain View, 
California. 
As we saw, Freddy included an early robot 
arm, but as you can see here, technology 
has come a long way. 
For example, this modern research robotic 
arm has many more capabilities. 
Obviously, there's a lot more to robotics 
than just activity planning and there are 
significant challenges in terms of 
vision, mechanical issues, and spatial 
reasoning including locating the robot, 
and tracking other objects. 
But planning is a key aspect of 
intelligent behavior. 
Not every robot has the kind of activity 
plan that we are describing on this 
course. 
That is, one which can plan from first 
principles. 
But robots typically do have plans, 
perhaps precompiled ones, that they use 
to control their behavior. 
AI Planners have been used in much more 
recent robots also, of course, such as in 
some humanoid robots and the robots used 
in the Annual RoboCup Soccer League 
Teams. 
Here, planning may have to cover the 
coordination of different robots with 
different roles, and the robots 
themselves can have planners on board 
that adjust their behaviors dynamically. 
The planners have been used in different 
kind of robots, too. 
For example, an on board planner and 
reactive execution agent was used to 
autonomously control the NASA Deep Space 
1 spacecraft prepared in its flight 
rounding over the comet. 
AI Planners have been used to provide 
adaptability and flexibility robots in 
the past and in the present, 
in the factory, in the home, and in the 
outer space. 
And it's nearing which to put good use 
tomorrow. 
We hope you'll be part in creating this 
future.
