[SOUND] AI Planners, using a generation 
of action sequences in robots such as the 

2
00:00:13,122 --> 00:00:18,167
Freddy 2, Hand/Eye Assembly Robot 
displayed here in the National Museum of 

3
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:22,993
Scotland in Edinburgh. 
This version of Freddy from four decades 

4
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:28,696
ago had a large, fixed mounted arm with 
sophisticated touch sensitive grippers, 

5
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:32,133
and a side mounted camera to look at its 
world. 

6
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:37,470
Instead of the robot moving to reach 
objects, the platform underneath the 

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,249
robot was shifted instead. 
Freddy was demonstrated on flexible 

8
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:46,760
assembly tasks involving simple toy, 
cars, and boats. 

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,310
The video playing is taken from a 16 
millimeter film of a Freddy project 

10
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,322
demonstration made in 1973. 
Freddy had to identify jumbled up parts 

11
00:00:57,322 --> 00:01:01,573
via vision, unscrambled the parts, and 
then assembled them to create the 

12
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:04,987
required product. 
Some parts in the area didn't belong to 

13
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:07,322
the target assembly. 
In one project, the Edinburgh, normally 

14
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:12,771
an AI Planner, was used to generate 
object construction and arm movement 

15
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:16,364
sequences for Freddy. 
In its time, Freddy was one of the most 

16
00:01:16,364 --> 00:01:25,702
sophisticated robots in the world. 
The Stanford Research Institute Problem 

17
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:30,346
Solver Strips is one of the best known a 
most influential AI Planners, and you'll 

18
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:34,584
learn about it on this course. 
Despite of being created over 40 years 

19
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:37,196
ago, 
it was already news control the activity 

20
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:41,666
of a robot called Shakey at the Stanford 
Research Institute, which is now call SRI 

21
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:44,569
International. 
Strips had may interesting features 

22
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:48,401
including use in theorem proving 
techniques to reason about the state of 

23
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:51,535
points in the plan. 
Strips gave us a representation of 

24
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:56,295
actions with preconditions and effects. 
It's got a mechanism called macrobes, for 

25
00:01:56,295 --> 00:02:00,740
generalization of its operators. 
It included execution support facilities 

26
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,062
to deal with partial failures. 
Shakey is now on display at the Computer 

27
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:07,680
History Museum in Mountain View, 
California. 

28
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,293
As we saw, Freddy included an early robot 
arm, but as you can see here, technology 

29
00:02:14,293 --> 00:02:18,222
has come a long way. 
For example, this modern research robotic 

30
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:22,860
arm has many more capabilities. 
Obviously, there's a lot more to robotics 

31
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,820
than just activity planning and there are 
significant challenges in terms of 

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,716
vision, mechanical issues, and spatial 
reasoning including locating the robot, 

33
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:36,517
and tracking other objects. 
But planning is a key aspect of 

34
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:40,440
intelligent behavior. 
Not every robot has the kind of activity 

35
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,137
plan that we are describing on this 
course. 

36
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:46,209
That is, one which can plan from first 
principles. 

37
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:50,849
But robots typically do have plans, 
perhaps precompiled ones, that they use 

38
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:56,786
to control their behavior. 
AI Planners have been used in much more 

39
00:02:56,786 --> 00:03:01,856
recent robots also, of course, such as in 
some humanoid robots and the robots used 

40
00:03:01,856 --> 00:03:04,485
in the Annual RoboCup Soccer League 
Teams. 

41
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:09,117
Here, planning may have to cover the 
coordination of different robots with 

42
00:03:09,117 --> 00:03:13,436
different roles, and the robots 
themselves can have planners on board 

43
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:21,134
that adjust their behaviors dynamically. 
The planners have been used in different 

44
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,419
kind of robots, too. 
For example, an on board planner and 

45
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,920
reactive execution agent was used to 
autonomously control the NASA Deep Space 

46
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,510
1 spacecraft prepared in its flight 
rounding over the comet. 

47
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,133
AI Planners have been used to provide 
adaptability and flexibility robots in 

48
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:41,148
the past and in the present, 
in the factory, in the home, and in the 

49
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:44,433
outer space. 
And it's nearing which to put good use 

50
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,414
tomorrow. 
We hope you'll be part in creating this 

51
00:03:47,414 --> 00:03:47,840
future.
