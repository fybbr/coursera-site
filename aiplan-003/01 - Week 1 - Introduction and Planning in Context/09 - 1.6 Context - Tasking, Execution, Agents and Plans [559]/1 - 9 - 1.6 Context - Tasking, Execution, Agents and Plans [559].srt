00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,071
Planning usually occurs in a human 
context where tasks or objectives are 

2
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:16,838
assigned, where plan execution must take 
place. 

3
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:21,349
We introduced earlier a model for 
planning and showed some simplifications 

4
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:23,875
to it. 
We explained that a richer model is 

5
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:27,003
needed for realistic planning in dynamic 
situations. 

6
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:31,815
In such a context, we've got to observe 
the performance of activity in the world, 

7
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:36,507
and try to observe and interpret the 
effects of our executed activities there. 

8
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:41,320
This can allow for possible plan revision 
and replanning where that's necessary. 

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,804
O-Plan for example, could be configured 
with three separate planning agents. 

10
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:52,082
Which represented reasons about plans at 
different levels. 

11
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:56,208
The first was concerned with the human 
level of task description, setting 

12
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,034
objectives, giving guidance, or overall 
constraints. 

13
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:02,990
A second level is a more technical 
planning level which could propose 

14
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,229
options to meet the state's objectives, 
and allow for choices between those 

15
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,546
options. 
And a third level supported plan 

16
00:01:09,546 --> 00:01:13,333
execution and monitoring. 
And could facilitate local planned repair 

17
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:16,759
where that was feasible. 
However, note that in each case here, 

18
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,070
each agent has a similar structure which 
is supported by the open planning 

19
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,060
architecture, in which the O-Plan planner 
was built. 

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,565
For example, the multi-agent planning 
architecture platform is the basis for 

21
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:42,047
the SRI International Side Planner. 
The Open Planning Architecture is the 

22
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:46,470
basis for O-Plan designed to handle 
multiple plan roles and levels as you 

23
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,585
just seen. 
And the I-X platform is intended to port 

24
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:54,383
multiple types of command, sense-making, 
analysis in planning for instances to 

25
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:58,681
build the I-plan · planner, as well as 
decision making, execution, and 

26
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:02,420
communication between agents even in 
mixed agent frameworks. 

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,808
Several practical AI planning systems 
have been used in emergency response 

28
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:12,906
applications. 
Often working in the context of a wide 

29
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:17,255
range of other agents and services. 
They're often in an environment where 

30
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:22,141
communication and collaboration is taking 
place with some sort of infrastructural 

31
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,524
layer. 
And then the core might concer, be 

32
00:02:24,524 --> 00:02:29,353
concerned with command and control-type 
issues in search-and-rescue or emergency 

33
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:33,044
response situations, but also dealing 
with people in the field. 

34
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:37,750
And so they are also manipulated the 
plans that they're given and adjusting 

35
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,680
them to a local situation. 
We may also be including the people who 

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,442
are in trouble or are isolated or being 
rescued as part of the framework of 

37
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:49,477
collaboration and communication that's 
taken place. 

38
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:53,941
And again, they have to deal with 
elements of the plan that are coming from 

39
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:56,620
these different levels and different 
centers. 

40
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,905
And we perhaps have to deal upwards with 
decision making authorities by giving 

41
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:06,989
briefings of the options that we're 
generating, explaining those, and looking 

42
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,940
for decisions on, on which ones are going 
to be executed and handled. 

43
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,219
We'll show you a couple of examples of 
I-X multiagent applications. 

44
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:23,737
This is an I-X process panel which sports 
a search and rescue coordinator and the 

45
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:28,635
communications with various other 
agencies and services in a coalition 

46
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:33,887
peace keeping operations. 
The second application called iGlobe 

47
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:39,489
handles the tasking and coordination of 
mobile ground and air vehicles in a 

48
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:47,211
disaster response scenario. 
Often, planning is just a small part of a 

49
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:51,868
wider collaboration and communication 
situation involved in a realistic 

50
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:55,361
application. 
The I-plan planner here sits in the lower 

51
00:03:55,361 --> 00:04:00,341
right, and it's quite a simple tool. 
But it operates in a much broader context 

52
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:04,740
of planned communication, messaging, map 
views, sense making, and so on. 

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,929
A paper written in 2001, was part of a 
special issue in Mayhem Magazine on 

54
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:17,517
Robocop, explored emergency response as a 
grand challenge for multiagent and 

55
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:21,151
intelligent systems. 
It explored the very many areas involved 

56
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:25,501
in effective emergency response, which 
could be supported by intelligence 

57
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:27,884
systems. 
These included dealing with the 

58
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:31,500
environment. 
Supporting the people and organizations 

59
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,855
involved, and of course, using 
intelligence systems to assist in the 

60
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:40,947
emergency itself. 
The key element of this support in both 

61
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:45,544
planning and activity management and the 
sharing of plan related information 

62
00:04:45,544 --> 00:04:51,384
between agents. 
Plenty used for communication and 

63
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:56,332
collaboration between agents and systems. 
So upon representation itself, is an 

64
00:04:56,332 --> 00:05:00,766
important area of research. 
Plenty used in many areas beyond activity 

65
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:03,593
planning. 
Such as in, situation understanding 

66
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:08,155
summarization, natural language 
interpretation, and generation and so on. 

67
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:13,103
Plents provide nontological informal 
representation call for a wide range of 

68
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:18,120
practical applications and uses. 
A good representation of plans can be 

69
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,574
used as a target for knowledge 
acquisition, for user communication, for 

70
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:27,860
system manipulation, and as a basis for 
formal analysis. 

71
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,682
AI planning work has influenced standard 
related process and plan representations 

72
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:39,093
used by many industries and fields. 
For example, in the MIT process handbook, 

73
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:43,562
its process interchange format or PIF. 
In the NIST, The National Institute of 

74
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:48,149
Standards and Technology in America. 
the Process Specification Language, PSL. 

75
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:52,619
And the DARPA, Shared Planning and 
Activity Representation SPAR. 

76
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,560
And has even become the basis for an ISO 
standard.
