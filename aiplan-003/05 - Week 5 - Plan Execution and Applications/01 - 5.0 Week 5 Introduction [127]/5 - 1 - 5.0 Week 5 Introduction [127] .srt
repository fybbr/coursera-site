00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:05,699
>> Welcome to the final week of the AI
planning course.

2
00:00:05,699 --> 00:00:13,545
I am glad you are still with us.
On this course, you have already learned a

3
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:17,162
lot of things.
I have described to you the planning

4
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:21,182
problem, and we have seen several
algorithms for solving this problem,

5
00:00:21,182 --> 00:00:25,872
including an algorithm that is behind one
of the state-of-the-art planners, one of

6
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:30,644
the fastest plan-generating systems today.
In this week, we're going to turn to less

7
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:35,514
technical material and go a lot broader.
First, my colleague Austin Tate will

8
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:40,410
describe to you some practical planners
and applications to which they have been

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,817
applied.
People describe some of the inside

10
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:46,661
technology which hopefully you will
recognize from what you have learned

11
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:49,619
previously.
Then, in this week's feature, we will look

12
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:53,802
at planning for missions in space.
Finally, I will describe to you some

13
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:57,721
topics that surround the planning problem
we've looked at so far.

14
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:02,271
For example, what happens before we can
plan, how we can come up with planning

15
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,781
domains?
Or what happens after planning?

16
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:09,028
How do we do planned execution?
And that will conclude the lectures for

17
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:13,353
this week and for the whole course.
Then you still have to do the exams.

18
00:01:13,354 --> 00:01:18,038
There is the awareness-level exam.
There is the foundation-level exam.

19
00:01:18,038 --> 00:01:23,384
And for those who want to pass the course
at the performance level, you will also

20
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:26,566
have to do the final programming
assignment.

21
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:27,560
And that's it.
