1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,153
This section of the course, we'll look at 
practical applications of AI planning and 

2
00:00:11,153 --> 00:00:16,731
the use of plans when executed. 
It'll also describe some common themes 

3
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:24,991
found in many practical AI planners. 
Plans only become useful when they're 

4
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:29,428
executed. 
Even the earliest AI planners were linked 

5
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:34,004
with plan execution capabilities, as 
shown by the use of the STRIPS planners 

6
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:38,340
alongside the PLANEX, plan execute over 
40 years ago in the Shakey robot. 

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,919
Sacerdoti's NOAH planner was used to 
follow along an apprentice engineer 

8
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:48,132
repaired a hydraulic pump and the system 
maintained a model of the state of the 

9
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:52,640
pump to build, suggest fixes when the 
apprentice ran into problems. 

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,352
Nonlin maintained the goal structure or 
rationale behind plan elements and could 

11
00:00:57,352 --> 00:01:01,391
use this as the basis for plan execution 
monitoring to spot significant 

12
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:05,655
divergences during the required outcome 
[INAUDIBLE] and their later uses to 

13
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:09,638
satisfy constraints in the plan. 
In some cases, alternative contributors 

14
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:14,126
to satisfy those required constraints can 
be found in the existing plan without 

15
00:01:14,126 --> 00:01:17,100
changing it. 
In other cases, problems could be spotted 

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,420
well in advance and suitable changes made 
before the problem became critical. 

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,557
SRI International work on SIPE and PRS, 
the Procedural Reasoning System, use rich 

18
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:33,547
representation of plans and processes, 
support execution, and recovery from 

19
00:01:33,547 --> 00:01:37,900
errors. 
Work at the University of Essex, in the 

20
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,858
U.K. 
Created a reactor planner, which 

21
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:44,263
maintained a representation of the flaws 
in the plan whether those arose at plan 

22
00:01:44,263 --> 00:01:47,852
time or during execution. 
It could apply fixes to these flaws in a 

23
00:01:47,852 --> 00:01:51,876
uniform manner, to provide an integrated 
planning, execution, and monitoring 

24
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:56,387
framework. 
Work in Chicago on RAP explored a 

25
00:01:56,387 --> 00:02:00,681
reactive agent architecture for 
representing plans that were suited for 

26
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:04,660
real-time plan execution monitoring in 
robots, for example. 

27
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,415
Our own O-Plan system include algorithms 
for plan repair and replanning in both 

28
00:02:09,415 --> 00:02:13,866
high tempo and less time constraint 
situations when execution monitoring 

29
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:17,585
indicated problems. 
Was not at all surprising is that many of 

30
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:22,218
the AI planners which were created to 
address practical applications also 

31
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:26,730
include technique support, execution, and 
monitoring of the outcome of plan 

32
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:32,930
execution. 
We'll now look in some depth, at a good 

33
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,200
example of our AI planning and plan 
execution techniques we used in practice. 

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,858
We'll see the importance of integrating 
planning into other key systems for 

35
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:47,025
real-time task assignment, system 
diagnosis, condition monitoring, and 

36
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:53,268
execution time plan repair. 
Deep Space 1 launched from Cape Canaveral 

37
00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:58,603
in 1998 and tested twelve advanced high 
risk technologies from space including 

38
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:01,860
ion thrusters and advanced on-board 
automation. 

39
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,873
In a successful extended mission, it 
operated through to 2001 and encountered 

40
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:12,586
Comet Borrelly. 
Deep Space 1 included a remote agent 

41
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:17,839
experiment, RAX, to demonstrate both 
ground-based and on-board AI remote plan 

42
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:22,290
execution. 
The spacecraft control application domain 

43
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,798
posed some tough requirements. 
High reliability was essential and issues 

44
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:31,620
could arrise from single point system 
failures are for more complex multiple 

45
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,858
cause problems. 
Deep space 1 operated under tight 

46
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:39,331
resource constraints for fuel and power, 
and frequently there would be multiple 

47
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:42,388
goals, you could not all be satisfied at 
the same time. 

48
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,521
Of course, given the nature of a very 
high speed fly-by of a target comet, 

49
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:50,768
deadlines were fixed and very tight. 
There's no second chance return if 

50
00:03:50,768 --> 00:03:54,901
essential observations and scientific 
goals are not achieved due to some 

51
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:59,260
precondition, not being satisfied, or 
some systems not being fully prepared at 

52
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,679
the critical time. 
Spacecraft did have sensors to report its 

53
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:06,793
status and the status of its instruments, 
but these only provide limited 

54
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:11,136
observability of the many conditions 
under which the spacecraft can operate. 

55
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,278
And of course. 
many things can be happening at the same 

56
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:17,821
time on a spacecraft. 
And some operations can take a long time 

57
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:21,592
to complete when started. 
There's no possibility of fully ordering 

58
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:24,677
and completing one activity before 
another must begin. 

59
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:29,477
So Deep Space 1 posed a very interesting 
and realistic example of a remote device 

60
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:33,420
that we might wish to control via more 
automated AI planning methods. 

61
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,318
The Deep Space 1 remote agent approach 
was to used constraint based planning and 

62
00:04:41,318 --> 00:04:44,676
scheduling. 
It had to deal with robust multi-threaded 

63
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:49,427
execution of the activities and it had to 
integrate with model-based fault 

64
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:53,862
diagnosis and reconfiguration. 
Real time control and monitoring of the 

65
00:04:53,862 --> 00:05:00,061
spacecraft was the key issue. 
Deep Space 1 could operate at various 

66
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:03,584
levels of autonomy. 
It could execute single commands or 

67
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:08,323
sequences of activities which are to be 
executed at some particular times. 

68
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:13,639
It could seek to achieve some given goal. 
It could maintain a model of the state of 

69
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,866
the spacecraft and detect errors from 
incoming sensor information. 

70
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:22,798
It could deal with a scripted plan and 
decompose that into greater levels of 

71
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:27,793
detail and it could deal with on-board 
back-to-back plan generation, execution 

72
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:30,740
and plan recovery in its most autonomous 
mode. 

73
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,663
This table provides a summary of the 
levels of autonomy on-board Deep Space 1 

74
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,255
and shows what elements can be done on 
the ground, on the on on-board planner 

75
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:45,820
and scheduler, and on the on-board 
execution system. 

76
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,454
So this goes right through to the most 
autonomous modes where plans can be 

77
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:55,026
prepared on the ground, they can be 
completed on-board the spacecraft, then 

78
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:58,980
take into account the situation the 
spacecraft is in and could be 

79
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:05,167
autonomously executed. 
So Deep Space 1 systems cover everything 

80
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:10,446
from the ground control through what's 
happening on the spacecraft itself. 

81
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:15,440
It involves planning, execution, and 
monitoring of the outcome of plans. 

82
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,528
Deep Space 1 remote agent experiment 
functionality includes the planner 

83
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:25,545
schedule and mission manager, 
which deals with the on-board generation 

84
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:29,387
of plans dealing with replanning when 
failures occur and so on. 

85
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:33,812
The Executor provides the low-level 
commanding interface that links back to 

86
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:37,188
the planet to initiate on-board planning 
when it's needed, 

87
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:41,787
and is linked to the mode identification 
recovery or diagnosis system on the 

88
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:45,979
spacecraft to make sure that we can 
confirm command execution meets its 

89
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:52,237
objectives. 
Deep space 1 planning could deal with a 

90
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:55,963
diversity of goals. 
Final state goals, such as turn off the 

91
00:06:55,963 --> 00:07:00,523
camera once you're done using it, 
schedule goals such as communicate to 

92
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:04,762
earth at pre-specified times. 
Periodic goals such as ensuring you take 

93
00:07:04,762 --> 00:07:07,910
a picture for navigation purposes every 
two days. 

94
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,557
Information-seeking goals such as asking 
the on-board navigation system to return 

95
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,574
its profile for the thrusters. 
continues accumulation goals such as 

96
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:21,336
making sure that over a given period, you 
make sure you accumulate enough thrust 

97
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:24,722
but it don't, these actions don't have to 
be on at specific times. 

98
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:29,083
And then default goals such as when 
you've got nothing else to do, point the 

99
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:33,501
high-gain antenna back to the earth to 
maintain good communications with the 

100
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:35,911
earth. 
And it can deal with a diversity of 

101
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:39,387
constraints, 
state action constraints such as to take 

102
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:44,146
a picture, the camera must be on. 
Dealing with finite resources such as 

103
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:47,352
power constraints. 
Dealing with true parallelism, 

104
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:52,703
where for instance, the attitude control 
system must work in parallel with the ion 

105
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:56,934
propulsion system controller. 
Functional dependencies, 

106
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:02,046
example is the duration of a turn depends 
on its source and its destination. 

107
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:07,292
Continuously varying parameters such as 
counting the amount of accumulated 

108
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:12,336
thrust, under the constraints that come 
from other kinds of specialized modules 

109
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:19,604
such as the on-board navigation system. 
A Deep Space 1 plan is in the form of 

110
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:23,941
timelines of the different instruments 
and when they're turned on and off, and 

111
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:28,334
various constraint, time constraints and 
all kinds of constraints, apply between 

112
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:35,562
the elements of this plan. 
This tool shows the stages of the exact 

113
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:41,309
system on-board the spacecraft. 
A Java applet was provided to allow 

114
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:46,040
observers to watch the remote agent 
experiments in real-time while it was 

115
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:54,465
operating. 
The actual flight experiment for Deep 

116
00:08:54,465 --> 00:09:00,382
Space 1 remote agent experiment took 
place 17th and the 21st of May, 1999. 

117
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:05,500
RAX was activated and controlled the Deep 
Space 1 Spacecraft autonomously, 

118
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,201
but some issues and alarms did arise. 
There was a divergence of the predicted 

119
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:14,919
value of the state of the ion propulsion 
system and the actual observed values. 

120
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:19,579
This was determined to be due to the 
infrequency of real-time monitor updates 

121
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:22,351
on the spacecraft. 
They EXEC deadlocked in use, 

122
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:25,713
the problem was diagnosed and a fix was 
designed quickly, 

123
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:30,432
but it was not uploaded to Deep Space 1 
for fears of the safety of the flight 

124
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:32,909
systems. 
This condition hadn't appeared in 

125
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:36,566
thousands of ground tests, 
which indicates the need for formal 

126
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:40,990
verification methods for this type of 
safety and mission critical software. 

127
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:46,028
Following later experiments, RAX was 
deemed to have achieve its aims and 

128
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:51,991
objectives. 
RAX controlled the spacecraft 

129
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:57,393
autonomously for two days. 
On the first day, typical operations took 

130
00:09:57,393 --> 00:10:00,709
place. 
The ion propulsion system was turned on 

131
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:05,366
and off at various times. 
The attitude control system was operated 

132
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:08,189
when appropriate, 
some images were taken, 

133
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:14,167
some on-board planning was performed. 
The second day included the injection of 

134
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:18,658
some simulated failures of the 
radiometric tracking and thruster systems 

135
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:23,220
in order to show how the planet could 
cope with these events. 

136
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,018
The final report to the Deep Space 1 
remote agent experiment concluded that 

137
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:30,724
the validation objectives had been 
achieved. 

138
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:35,338
The system was able to do what both 
ground-based and on-board autonomously 

139
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:40,382
generated plans and execute those plans 
in the face of failures and re-plan where 

140
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:43,211
required. 
And it did this through capabilities, 

141
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:47,579
which included robust goal-based 
commanding, and integration with the 

142
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:50,040
on-board model-based fault recovery 
system. 

143
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:58,645
So to summarize, Deep Space 1 remote 
agent experiment featured an AI planner 

144
00:10:58,645 --> 00:11:04,702
outer level with re-planning capability, 
detailed constraint handling for time and 

145
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:08,982
resources, 
integration with system diagnostics and 

146
00:11:08,982 --> 00:11:12,468
analysis, 
integration of plan exclusion and 

147
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:18,440
monitoring, 
rich domain description languages, 

148
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,060
and involved comprehensive user 
interfaces.
