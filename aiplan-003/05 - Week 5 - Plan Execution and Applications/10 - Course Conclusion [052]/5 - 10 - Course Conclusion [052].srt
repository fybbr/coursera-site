1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,895
This concludes the course on AI Planning. 
You have seen that there are wide variety 

2
00:00:10,895 --> 00:00:14,376
of methods and techniques, 
but that the basic technology for 

3
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:18,786
representation and reasoning about plans 
has some core principles, which are 

4
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:22,093
broadly useful. 
Practical applications of AI Planning are 

5
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:26,793
in every day use and suitable problems 
can be addressed by the methods taught on 

6
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:29,636
this course. 
You have now learned about the basic 

7
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:34,393
techniques underlying most AI Planners. 
This should allow you to read state of 

8
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:38,745
the art research papers on planning and 
you should be able to understand their 

9
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:41,825
potential for problems you are working 
on. 

10
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:48,173
We hope you enjoyed the course and that 
you will find the techniques useful and 

11
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,743
relevant for your future activity. 
Goodbye. 

12
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:52,061
Bye.
