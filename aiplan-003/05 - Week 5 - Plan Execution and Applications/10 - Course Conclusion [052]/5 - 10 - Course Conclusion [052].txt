This concludes the course on AI Planning. 
You have seen that there are wide variety 
of methods and techniques, 
but that the basic technology for 
representation and reasoning about plans 
has some core principles, which are 
broadly useful. 
Practical applications of AI Planning are 
in every day use and suitable problems 
can be addressed by the methods taught on 
this course. 
You have now learned about the basic 
techniques underlying most AI Planners. 
This should allow you to read state of 
the art research papers on planning and 
you should be able to understand their 
potential for problems you are working 
on. 
We hope you enjoyed the course and that 
you will find the techniques useful and 
relevant for your future activity. 
Goodbye. 
Bye.
