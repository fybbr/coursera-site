00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,753
>> Hi, I'm Brad Clement.
I'm going to talk about Artificial

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:08,986
Intelligence for Space Applications.
I worked for the NASA Jet Propulsion

3
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:12,707
Laboratory.
Jpl was a lead US center for robotic space

4
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:18,339
exploration and has space-based programs
in the earth sciences and astronomy.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,084
Jpl Spacecraft have visited every planet
of the solar system.

6
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:28,230
This is an aerial view of JPL.
You can visit JPL's mission control room

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,734
where you can see missions uploading
commands to their spacecraft using the

8
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:38,291
Deep Space Network.
You can also go to the MarsYard and try to

9
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:43,756
scare the rover with loud noises.
>> So why would a space mission want

10
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:47,065
automated planning?
There's several reasons.

11
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:52,526
Spacecraft are complex and expensive.
Part of that expense is rocket fuel, the

12
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:56,094
launch.
The bigger the spacecraft, the more rocket

13
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:58,036
fuel.
So cost limits mass.

14
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:02,926
Well, mass limits power, because of the
size of solar rays and if you limit power,

15
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:07,291
you limit communication signal strength
which restricts bandwidth.

16
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:12,401
And bandwidth is critical resource for
spacecraft because oftentimes, it collect

17
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:15,933
data a lot more quickly than you can send
it back to earth.

18
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:21,702
So, these limitations and the complexity
of the spacecraft subsystems, will capture

19
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:26,186
many rules and constraints for operating
the spacecraft safely.

20
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:31,169
This complexity can be overwhelming for
science and operation staff, thus

21
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:36,283
operations are also expensive.
And spacecraft have a limited lifetime, so

22
00:01:36,283 --> 00:01:41,587
inefficient use of the spacecraft can
reduce the value of the entire mission.

23
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:46,431
Also, mistakes can be disastrous.
Automation promises to reduce complexity

24
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:50,945
of operation, avoid human error, thus
reducing mission cost and risk.

25
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:56,217
That's not the only reason for planning.
For a space mission, everything needs to

26
00:01:56,217 --> 00:02:01,365
be thought out in advance, because, once
the spacecraft is launched, you can't

27
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:06,382
replace the battery or add more memory.
In addition, communication signals can

28
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:10,802
take minutes to hours to reach the
spacecraft And communication is not always

29
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:13,689
available.
So, the spacecraft needs to be able to

30
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:17,222
receive a batch of commands and be able to
operate on its own.

31
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:21,613
You can't joystick the spacecraft.
This requires predicting what's going to

32
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:24,970
happen.
Well, if the environment is unpredictable,

33
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,484
then the spacecraft should be able to
operate on their own and be able to do

34
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:34,140
their own prediction, their own plan.
So, automate planning not only helps

35
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,180
scientists in operations planning, but
also enable spacecraft to operate on their

36
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,132
own in a predictable environment.
For these reasons, automated planning has

37
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:48,932
been used by science and operations
planning to figure out what to do and when

38
00:02:48,932 --> 00:02:51,771
to do it.
And it has been used for autonomously

39
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:55,937
commanding a spacecraft.
Planning has been used to figure out how

40
00:02:55,937 --> 00:03:00,031
to manipulate solar rays from an
International Space Station.

41
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:04,720
It's even been used for project management
for the construction of rockets.

42
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,646
So what's challenging about, about space
applications?

43
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,684
Scale is one of them.
You could have a schedule with tens of

44
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:14,742
thousands of activities, tens of hundreds
of statement resource variables.

45
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:17,403
And model [unknown] resources can be
complex too.

46
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:21,253
There's a conflex interaction between
solar rays and the battery in power

47
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:25,067
availability.
Temperature is difficult to model and how

48
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:29,301
would you model a fall system.
Well, you might be able to model how the

49
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:33,994
spacecraft works, but can you produce
schedules that the user really wants?

50
00:03:33,994 --> 00:03:37,032
Sometimes the user can't tell you what
they want.

51
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:41,673
Also, can you gurantee every plan that
comes out of your playing system is going

52
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:44,961
to be saved properly and won't crash the
spacecraft?

53
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:50,001
On board the spacecraft, the CPU is about
a thousand times slower than your desktop.

54
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:54,831
I'll briefly describe the history of AI
planning in space applications, some of

55
00:03:54,831 --> 00:03:58,181
the planners and their deployments
spanning 30 years.

56
00:03:58,181 --> 00:04:02,743
In the early '70s, JPL began designing the
Mars Rover and recognize that the rover

57
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,488
would need planning capabilities.
That's about the time JPL began

58
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:09,910
researching planning.
In the early 1980s, the DEVISER planner

59
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,005
was used for activity planning for the
Voyager mission and its encounter with

60
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:16,693
Uranus.
But many of the planners from the 80s and

61
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:20,847
90s is written in the functional
programming language Lisp and inherited

62
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:25,403
traits from the Nonlin planner, such as
partial order planning, subgoaling, and

63
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:28,692
backward chaining.
This is done by starting out with the

64
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:32,752
goals and the plans, which is the one at
the bottom of the page, and then

65
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:36,510
establishing those goals with the effects
from other actions.

66
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,918
And then establishing the preconditions of
those actions through the effects of other

67
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,246
actions, thus building the plan from the
initial state to the goals.

68
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:49,821
The new thing the DEVISER brought was time
windows.

69
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:54,707
The reason about metric time, concurrency
in the form of simple temporal

70
00:04:54,707 --> 00:05:00,387
constraints, where time points vary within
some ranging or constrained to be within

71
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:04,972
some range of each other.
Plan-it has been built as an improvement

72
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,077
on DEVISER.
As you can see, it's been used in a wide

73
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:12,993
variety of applications over the years.
One thing that it did differently is it

74
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:17,884
started to model resources explicitly in
the language, and, it also took a local

75
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,496
search approach called heuristic,
iterative repair.

76
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:26,304
The problem with building up a plan like a
partial order is that you can spend a long

77
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:30,963
time trying to figure out the solution and
then be left with just a partial plan.

78
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:35,257
The great thing about local search
approach is you always have some schedule

79
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:38,962
that you're working with.
It may have conflict and flaws on it, but

80
00:05:38,962 --> 00:05:43,317
you're iteratively working on the same
schedule, that way you don't have, have

81
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:47,806
problems with growing memory and you have
a best effort solution or in any type of

82
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,634
solution.
A couple of years after planning was

83
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:55,324
scheduled for the Deep Space Network,
British National Space Centre launched a

84
00:05:55,324 --> 00:06:00,504
technology-proven satellite project under
which the T-SCHED scheduler generated a 24

85
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:05,116
hour plan that was uploaded and executed
live on board UoSAT-II satellite.

86
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:08,768
You'll hear me mix the words planning and
scheduling.

87
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,856
Scheduling is implicitly a part of
planning.

88
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:17,520
Planning is about figuring out what to do,
scheduling is about figuring out when to

89
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,193
do it and what resources to use.
A Spike scheduler is in use by several

90
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:27,053
missions, most notably the great
observatories, like the Hubble Space

91
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,487
Telescope.
Spike takes a different approach than the

92
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:34,848
other planes we were talked about.
It represents a schedule and problems

93
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:39,472
constraint optimization, like a system of
equations that needs to solve for.

94
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:43,880
Then it has three main stages, a trial
assignment, repair where it tries to

95
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,365
resolve complex observations.
You're going to [unknown] stage, where it

96
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:52,289
removes the activities or it relaxes
constraints of something.

97
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:57,332
With the Hubble Space Telescope, Spike
schedules an entire year at the resolution

98
00:06:57,332 --> 00:07:00,665
of a minute.
That's between 10,000 and 30,000

99
00:07:00,665 --> 00:07:04,678
observations.
And its user-authorizing, because it has

100
00:07:04,678 --> 00:07:10,038
constraints which span several months,
such as you can't take an observation of

101
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,053
the same target within 2 months of
another.

102
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:18,526
The Optimum-AIV planner was developed by
the European Space Agency for the Assembly

103
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:23,454
Integration and Verification of the
vehicle equipment bays for the Ariane 4

104
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:26,450
rockets.
Like Spike, it treats the plane

105
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,791
[inaudible] problem with resource in
temporal constraints.

106
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:34,458
However, it's [inaudible] is similar to
DEVISERS and planets.

107
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:39,292
The Remote Agent Experiment was the first
to demonstrate planning and executions on

108
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,936
board a spacecraft.
There are three main list components that

109
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:46,503
autonomously operate at the Deep Space 1
mission for 2 days.

110
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:51,274
Nasa Ames Research Center is responsible
for the planner[SOUND]cheduler and the

111
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:54,821
mode identification reconfiguration called
Livingstone.

112
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:57,473
Jpl will develop the EXEC, smart
executive.

113
00:07:57,473 --> 00:08:02,159
In simulation it also demonstrated the
response to unexpected events while on

114
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:04,551
board.
This is a common integration of

115
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:07,749
components.
The planner[SOUND]cheduler is at the top

116
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:12,441
with the Liberty player, underneath is
monitoring and execution, at the bottom is

117
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:15,361
the actual actuators, and the hardware or
robot.

118
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:20,196
Sensor and state information typically
flow up the layers and commands flow down.

119
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:25,722
The Earth Observing-1 spacecraft has been
operated by autonomous planning since

120
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:29,130
2004.
Eo1 participates in main space networks

121
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,460
through the aqua spacecraft is downlinking
images as usual, and one of them is

122
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,790
detected to have changed since the last
time it was finished by software on the

123
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:43,140
ground.
This software signals EO1 to span a high

124
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,552
resolution image goal for its schedule the
time, it's planner reschedules its

125
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:53,800
activities, so then it can smooth the
spacecraft and get the image on its next

126
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,544
pass enabling a quicker response to this
forest fire.

127
00:08:57,544 --> 00:09:02,091
That was CASPER on board EO1.
This is this continual version of ASPEN

128
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:07,632
JPL stochastic iterative repair planner.
It's the first planner we talked about

129
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:10,952
that's not written in Lisp, but instead,
C++.

130
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:15,176
Casper is also part of the Autonomous
Sciencecraft Experiment that's on board

131
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:17,410
EO1.
This also includes machine learning

132
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,442
algorithms that were used for detecting
different kinds of phenomena in the

133
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:24,029
images.
In this case, screening out images that

134
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,508
recorded clouds instead of the actual
target.

135
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:31,134
Here, it notices that there's a difference
in images, triggering it to take another

136
00:09:31,134 --> 00:09:35,666
high resolution image of the target on
which they discovered volcanic activity.

137
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:40,429
That's going to save the MAMM, EO1, and
DARPA Orbital Express missions millions of

138
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:43,245
dollars.
It's currently being used to schedule

139
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:45,866
ground antennas for the Deep Space
Network.

140
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:50,771
Proba-1, the first in a series of several
autonomy missions demonstrated on board

141
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:54,752
scheduling resource management.
That saying, this Europa planner is

142
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:59,030
evolved from the planner[SOUND]cheduler
used in the Remote Agent Experiment now

143
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,088
written in C++.
Its constraint programming approach to

144
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:06,696
planning and scheduling and, as before, it
does not differentiate between action and

145
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:09,480
states.
Treat them both as variables with temporal

146
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,482
extent, and like most other planar, it's
language is object oriented, this is very

147
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:16,111
convenient for representing large problem
domains.

148
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:20,351
And it has its own CLIP-based interactive
development environments and is integrated

149
00:10:20,351 --> 00:10:23,889
with SPIFe, the human centered planing
tool which that used for many NASA

150
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,808
missions.
This part of MAPGEN built to help the Mars

151
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:31,293
Exploration Rover mission pack more
activities into their plans increasing

152
00:10:31,293 --> 00:10:34,447
their efficiency.
It's also been used to plan out the

153
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:38,286
movement and orientation of solar arrays
for the space station.

154
00:10:38,286 --> 00:10:43,053
European Space Agency, MEXAR and RAXEM
planners were used for uplink and downlink

155
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:47,469
planning for the Mars Express mission
where they reduce planning effort and

156
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:52,692
increase science return.
So what does the future hold for AI

157
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:59,060
planning for space?
Well, how about making rovers autonomous?

158
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:05,174
Turns out that the rovers already use AI
style path planning.

159
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:10,637
As you'll see, rover navigation is very
sophisticated.

160
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:22,699
[music].
[music].

161
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:41,118
Class, today's lesson is autonomous way
point navigation in natural terrain.

162
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:52,003
This is your designated goal location.
First, watch this video to learn how it's

163
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:56,478
done.
There are ongoing efforts at JPL to make

164
00:11:56,478 --> 00:12:04,007
rovers autonomous in different ways.
One effort, AEGIS, integrates planning,

165
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:10,142
machine learning, and science knowledge.
But rovers do not yet use autonomous

166
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:12,846
planning.
Other parts of AEGIS in use by MER so are

167
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:17,266
constantly discovering and investigate
high valued science targets during one

168
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:24,110
traverse.
There are wide variety of other

169
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:40,187
applications and challenges that require
research and planning like human robot

170
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:46,811
exploration teams.
Tele-operated robots, mission and vehicle

171
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:51,348
design, robotic instruction habitats.
Other than the rover, there are other

172
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:55,688
kinds of planetary exploration vehicles
that [inaudible] need to handle

173
00:12:55,688 --> 00:13:00,504
uncertainty brought by weather or ocean
currents, like aerobots or hydrobots.

174
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:05,842
Planning is also apart of research in
related fields, such as testing,

175
00:13:05,842 --> 00:13:11,328
verification, and validation.
For example, what are good scenarios to

176
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:13,760
test?
What are good test cases?

177
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,467
And how should they be ordered to more
quickly find bugs or other problems?

178
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:24,784
Over the past 30 years, AI planning has
shown its value in many ways.

179
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:28,052
But still, very few missions actually take
advantage of it.

180
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:32,673
There are unlimited number of applications
and opportunities where AI planning can

181
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:36,031
make a big impact.
There are many demonstrations of automated

182
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:39,694
planning, but few are operational.
In order for AI planning to gain

183
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:44,116
widespread acceptance, we need to make it
easier to hand off automated planning

184
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:48,659
systems to the domain experts and take the
algorithm experts out of the, the loop.

185
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:51,715
User interface design is key for solving
this problem.

186
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:55,491
Farther in the future, there are many
mission concepts that will need

187
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:59,976
capabilities that deployed planners do not
have today including reasoning about

188
00:13:59,976 --> 00:14:03,160
uncertainty.
There are many areas of planning research

189
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,547
that can have a great impact on a wide
range of applications.

190
00:14:06,548 --> 00:14:13,193
I hope you found this information helpful.
Thank you for your attention.
