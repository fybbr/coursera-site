1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,362
We'll now look at a number of AI Planners 
and the type of application in which 

2
00:00:13,362 --> 00:00:18,298
they've been used. 
Earlier in the course we showed a table 

3
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:21,799
with a number of practical planners 
applied in realistic situations. 

4
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:25,659
And we noted the long history of the 
practical application of our planning 

5
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,130
methods. 
And during the course, we described some 

6
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,549
the key techniques employed in search 
planners. 

7
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:34,616
We're going to now explore a number of 
these systems, the features they include, 

8
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:39,966
and their applications. 
SIPE-2 System for Interactive Planning 

9
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:44,503
and Execution was created in the 1980s 
and has been developed since then to 

10
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,368
provide a comprehensive approach to AI 
planning. 

11
00:00:47,368 --> 00:00:52,143
It's been developed by David Wilkins and 
his colleagues at SRI International in 

12
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:55,400
California. 
SIPE-2 is a domain independent planner 

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,285
which supports interactive planning, 
allowing humans and system to co-operate 

14
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:05,296
in a mixed initiative planning fashion. 
It can efficiently reason about actions 

15
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:10,498
to generate the novel sequence of actions 
that respond precisely, to the situation 

16
00:01:10,498 --> 00:01:13,352
at hand. 
It supports the giving advice to the 

17
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:16,265
planner. 
It plans a hierarchical at different 

18
00:01:16,265 --> 00:01:19,320
levels of abstraction, 
replans during exclusion, 

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,000
can generate parallel plans, so it can 
allow for multiple agent planning. 

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,875
Post constraints and reasons about 
resources within the plan and interacts 

21
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:36,010
with users through a graphical interface. 
SIPE-2 has been applied in applications 

22
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,491
as diverse as, oil spill response, 
military planning, and production line 

23
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:46,710
planning in a brewery. 
O-Plan was built by my own team at 

24
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,367
University of Edinburgh through the 1980s 
and 1990s. 

25
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:55,378
It was based on the features in the 
earlier nautaline hierarchical test 

26
00:01:55,378 --> 00:01:59,188
planner. 
O-Plan supported the whole life cycle of 

27
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:01,880
planning. 
From domain modeling and knowledge of 

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,972
list station tools. 
Through planning, detail constraint 

29
00:02:04,972 --> 00:02:09,039
management, and plan execution. 
He was able to repair plans, or replan as 

30
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,501
necessary, when execution failures 
occurred. 

31
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:16,140
And O-Plan experimented with a wide range 
of graphical user interfaces, including 

32
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,894
support for multiple concurrent users 
with different roles in the planning 

33
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:23,070
process. 
And the workflows involved in 

34
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,538
coordinating between multiple users. 
It supported a web interface to allow the 

35
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:37,303
planner to be used as a web service. 
O-Plan is being used in Edinburgh and 

36
00:02:37,303 --> 00:02:39,639
elsewhere for a wide range of 
applications. 

37
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,463
Some of which were introduced earlier in 
the course. 

38
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:45,776
And as noted previously, 
O-Plan was used at the bases for the 

39
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:49,903
design of the deployed optimum AIV 
planner at the European Space Agency for 

40
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:53,760
Ariane rocket launch and payload base, 
sample integration and test. 

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,154
Shop and it's successor Shop two were 
created at University of Maryland by Dana 

42
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:06,118
Now and his colleagues. 
Shop two is hierarchical task network 

43
00:03:06,118 --> 00:03:08,627
planner. 
But keeps the activities in the plan 

44
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:11,638
fully ordered. 
It selects activities to include in the 

45
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:14,593
order they'll be executed from the start 
of the plan. 

46
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:18,997
Which eases reasoning about the state of 
the world affected by the plan, at any 

47
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:21,562
point. 
Shop two does allow for interleaving of 

48
00:03:21,562 --> 00:03:26,022
the solutions more multiple goals and 
subgoals in this ordered plan which is an 

49
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:28,420
improvement over the original shop 
planner. 

50
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,407
Shop two can reason with a rich logical 
model of the state, including quantifiers 

51
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:37,745
and conditionals. 
And can maintain and reason out temple 

52
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:41,023
constraints as is required for most 
practical planners. 

53
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:45,672
And it allows for numeric computations 
alongside the most symbolic will state 

54
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:48,473
models. 
Calls to external routines are possible 

55
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:51,632
to incorporate constraints expressed in 
program code. 

56
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:55,805
And the rich domain model allows 
preferences on choosing operators in 

57
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:59,560
given situations, feature seen in other 
practical planners, also. 

58
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,374
Shop and Shop two have been applied to a 
wide range of applications as diverse as 

59
00:04:07,374 --> 00:04:12,374
fighting forest fires, controlling 
multiple unmanned autonomous vehicles, 

60
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:16,000
UAVs, and creating business process 
workflows. 

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,091
The shop techniques have also been 
incorporating some domains specific 

62
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:24,239
planning applications embeded in 
manufacturing automated systems and in 

63
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:28,446
versions of the commercially available 
Ridge Barren device which won the 

64
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:31,500
Inaugural World Compute Bridge 
Championships in 1997. 

65
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,920
There are some common themes we can see 
appearing in many of the practical 

66
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,590
planners we've described. 
The use of an outer hierarchical task 

67
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,554
network approach which is friendly and 
understandable to users. 

68
00:04:50,554 --> 00:04:54,518
An underlying detailed 
constraint-handling layer to handle the 

69
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:57,916
real needs of time and resource 
constraints and plans. 

70
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:02,887
Integration with simulation analysis 
systems to prune or further constrain the 

71
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:07,669
plans which about are useful. 
Integration with plan execution and plan 

72
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:12,723
monitoring to put plans into real use. 
Rich knowledge modelling languages, and 

73
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:17,582
ways to describe features of application 
domains in ways which the planner can use 

74
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:21,037
to constrain choices. 
And availability of comprehensive and 

75
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:24,140
useful user interfaces during planning 
and execution.
