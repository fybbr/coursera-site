We'll now look at a number of AI Planners 
and the type of application in which 
they've been used. 
Earlier in the course we showed a table 
with a number of practical planners 
applied in realistic situations. 
And we noted the long history of the 
practical application of our planning 
methods. 
And during the course, we described some 
the key techniques employed in search 
planners. 
We're going to now explore a number of 
these systems, the features they include, 
and their applications. 
SIPE-2 System for Interactive Planning 
and Execution was created in the 1980s 
and has been developed since then to 
provide a comprehensive approach to AI 
planning. 
It's been developed by David Wilkins and 
his colleagues at SRI International in 
California. 
SIPE-2 is a domain independent planner 
which supports interactive planning, 
allowing humans and system to co-operate 
in a mixed initiative planning fashion. 
It can efficiently reason about actions 
to generate the novel sequence of actions 
that respond precisely, to the situation 
at hand. 
It supports the giving advice to the 
planner. 
It plans a hierarchical at different 
levels of abstraction, 
replans during exclusion, 
can generate parallel plans, so it can 
allow for multiple agent planning. 
Post constraints and reasons about 
resources within the plan and interacts 
with users through a graphical interface. 
SIPE-2 has been applied in applications 
as diverse as, oil spill response, 
military planning, and production line 
planning in a brewery. 
O-Plan was built by my own team at 
University of Edinburgh through the 1980s 
and 1990s. 
It was based on the features in the 
earlier nautaline hierarchical test 
planner. 
O-Plan supported the whole life cycle of 
planning. 
From domain modeling and knowledge of 
list station tools. 
Through planning, detail constraint 
management, and plan execution. 
He was able to repair plans, or replan as 
necessary, when execution failures 
occurred. 
And O-Plan experimented with a wide range 
of graphical user interfaces, including 
support for multiple concurrent users 
with different roles in the planning 
process. 
And the workflows involved in 
coordinating between multiple users. 
It supported a web interface to allow the 
planner to be used as a web service. 
O-Plan is being used in Edinburgh and 
elsewhere for a wide range of 
applications. 
Some of which were introduced earlier in 
the course. 
And as noted previously, 
O-Plan was used at the bases for the 
design of the deployed optimum AIV 
planner at the European Space Agency for 
Ariane rocket launch and payload base, 
sample integration and test. 
Shop and it's successor Shop two were 
created at University of Maryland by Dana 
Now and his colleagues. 
Shop two is hierarchical task network 
planner. 
But keeps the activities in the plan 
fully ordered. 
It selects activities to include in the 
order they'll be executed from the start 
of the plan. 
Which eases reasoning about the state of 
the world affected by the plan, at any 
point. 
Shop two does allow for interleaving of 
the solutions more multiple goals and 
subgoals in this ordered plan which is an 
improvement over the original shop 
planner. 
Shop two can reason with a rich logical 
model of the state, including quantifiers 
and conditionals. 
And can maintain and reason out temple 
constraints as is required for most 
practical planners. 
And it allows for numeric computations 
alongside the most symbolic will state 
models. 
Calls to external routines are possible 
to incorporate constraints expressed in 
program code. 
And the rich domain model allows 
preferences on choosing operators in 
given situations, feature seen in other 
practical planners, also. 
Shop and Shop two have been applied to a 
wide range of applications as diverse as 
fighting forest fires, controlling 
multiple unmanned autonomous vehicles, 
UAVs, and creating business process 
workflows. 
The shop techniques have also been 
incorporating some domains specific 
planning applications embeded in 
manufacturing automated systems and in 
versions of the commercially available 
Ridge Barren device which won the 
Inaugural World Compute Bridge 
Championships in 1997. 
There are some common themes we can see 
appearing in many of the practical 
planners we've described. 
The use of an outer hierarchical task 
network approach which is friendly and 
understandable to users. 
An underlying detailed 
constraint-handling layer to handle the 
real needs of time and resource 
constraints and plans. 
Integration with simulation analysis 
systems to prune or further constrain the 
plans which about are useful. 
Integration with plan execution and plan 
monitoring to put plans into real use. 
Rich knowledge modelling languages, and 
ways to describe features of application 
domains in ways which the planner can use 
to constrain choices. 
And availability of comprehensive and 
useful user interfaces during planning 
and execution.
