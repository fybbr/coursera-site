This is demonstration of Nonlin running 
in Poplog First, going to change the 
directory where Nonlin is located, 
and then load the source file. 
We're offered the choice of loading a 
critical path calculation package which 
we're going to do. There's some errors in 
it in certain versions of Poplog, we can 
just ignore that. And then, we look at 
the main menu which is called TF Info. 
We'll load a new TF file, 
in this case, it's going to be block 
zero, block zero. 
Which is a demonstration of the Sussman, 
and normally block second problem. 
And now, we'll give the goal schemer, 
which is to plan for the goal on AB and 
the goal on BC. 
So, we're going to make a stack of 
blocks. 
And that's the plan already created. 
There's some diagnostics that are showing 
while the expansion was taking place. 
So, we're going to look at the results 
network. 
We'll go through all of the different 
options here. 
So we're looking at the main results 
network, 
it's got a few dummy nodes and so on in 
there and we can get a cleaner version 
just with the actions only. 
We're showing there the predecessors and 
successors of each, each node. 
And then, we're going to look at the 
critical path data. 
But in this case, the data is all zeroed 
out because there is no data in it. 
Then, we're looking at the goal structure 
table and the table of multiple effects. 
We'll look at any initial context in the 
plan and the, the, initial state for the 
plan. 
And we can do a simulation of what the 
state looks like at any point in the 
plan. 
In this case, we'll just look at it at 
the end node. 
So, this is the state at the end of the 
plan having been executed. 
We'll load a new domain now. 
In this case, it's going to be a house 
building task with some critical path 
method data in it, 
some durations and times. 
So we'll set up a task for this one which 
is just to build a house, to expand a 
top-level action of building the house. 
And again, that's plan created so we'll 
just look at the results. 
And again, we're going to through all the 
options. 
We'll just see the main results network 
with all of the dummy nodes in, in place. 
And we'll look at it just cleaned just 
with the actions. 
And then, we'll going to look at it with 
the critical path method data which will 
give us the durations, the early 
finishes, and the late finishes for each 
node. 
And the start, the role starts means it's 
on the critical path. 
And again, we're looking at the gold 
structure table, 
and the table of multiple effects. 
And again, the initial context there is 
none in this case. 
And then, we'll look at the context of a 
particular node doing a node simulation. 
In this case, again, we'll look at the 
state at the end of the plan.
