1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,036
This is demonstration of Nonlin running 
in Poplog First, going to change the 

2
00:00:11,036 --> 00:00:17,820
directory where Nonlin is located, 
and then load the source file. 

3
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,513
We're offered the choice of loading a 
critical path calculation package which 

4
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:43,636
we're going to do. There's some errors in 
it in certain versions of Poplog, we can 

5
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:48,380
just ignore that. And then, we look at 
the main menu which is called TF Info. 

6
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,959
We'll load a new TF file, 
in this case, it's going to be block 

7
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:56,623
zero, block zero. 
Which is a demonstration of the Sussman, 

8
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:02,501
and normally block second problem. 
And now, we'll give the goal schemer, 

9
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:06,699
which is to plan for the goal on AB and 
the goal on BC. 

10
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,600
So, we're going to make a stack of 
blocks. 

11
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,056
And that's the plan already created. 
There's some diagnostics that are showing 

12
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:19,555
while the expansion was taking place. 
So, we're going to look at the results 

13
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:21,790
network. 
We'll go through all of the different 

14
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,220
options here. 
So we're looking at the main results 

15
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,552
network, 
it's got a few dummy nodes and so on in 

16
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:30,120
there and we can get a cleaner version 
just with the actions only. 

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,469
We're showing there the predecessors and 
successors of each, each node. 

18
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,567
And then, we're going to look at the 
critical path data. 

19
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:42,036
But in this case, the data is all zeroed 
out because there is no data in it. 

20
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:47,280
Then, we're looking at the goal structure 
table and the table of multiple effects. 

21
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,960
We'll look at any initial context in the 
plan and the, the, initial state for the 

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,877
plan. 
And we can do a simulation of what the 

23
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:00,660
state looks like at any point in the 
plan. 

24
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,842
In this case, we'll just look at it at 
the end node. 

25
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:08,150
So, this is the state at the end of the 
plan having been executed. 

26
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,297
We'll load a new domain now. 
In this case, it's going to be a house 

27
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:15,984
building task with some critical path 
method data in it, 

28
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:20,396
some durations and times. 
So we'll set up a task for this one which 

29
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:25,400
is just to build a house, to expand a 
top-level action of building the house. 

30
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,540
And again, that's plan created so we'll 
just look at the results. 

31
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,790
And again, we're going to through all the 
options. 

32
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,228
We'll just see the main results network 
with all of the dummy nodes in, in place. 

33
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:51,340
And we'll look at it just cleaned just 
with the actions. 

34
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,391
And then, we'll going to look at it with 
the critical path method data which will 

35
00:02:57,391 --> 00:03:01,508
give us the durations, the early 
finishes, and the late finishes for each 

36
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:04,139
node. 
And the start, the role starts means it's 

37
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,173
on the critical path. 
And again, we're looking at the gold 

38
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:16,078
structure table, 
and the table of multiple effects. 

39
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:20,523
And again, the initial context there is 
none in this case. 

40
00:03:20,523 --> 00:03:26,450
And then, we'll look at the context of a 
particular node doing a node simulation. 

41
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:31,340
In this case, again, we'll look at the 
state at the end of the plan.
