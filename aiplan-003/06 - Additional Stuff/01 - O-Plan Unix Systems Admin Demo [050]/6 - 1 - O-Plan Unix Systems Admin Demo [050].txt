This is a demonstration of O plan. 
Running on a simple single shot planning 
example. 
We call it Unix volume groups. 
What we're doing here is selecting a 
number of logical volumes to map against 
a number of physical volumes in the UNIX 
systems administration environment. 
And the planner which we are just going 
to run, that's it already run, is 
producing a script which can safely 
remove the volume mappings. 
This a good example of generative AI 
planner being used in an appropriate 
application area, previously a complex 
deeply nested script was used and its 
maintenance was difficult and error 
prone.
