00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,517
This is a demonstration of O plan. 
Running on a simple single shot planning 

2
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:15,020
example. 
We call it Unix volume groups. 

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,070
What we're doing here is selecting a 
number of logical volumes to map against 

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,992
a number of physical volumes in the UNIX 
systems administration environment. 

5
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:29,460
And the planner which we are just going 
to run, that's it already run, is 

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,540
producing a script which can safely 
remove the volume mappings. 

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,599
This a good example of generative AI 
planner being used in an appropriate 

8
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:45,713
application area, previously a complex 
deeply nested script was used and its 

9
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:48,540
maintenance was difficult and error 
prone.
