1
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:13,281
The SenseMaker receives a report about fire in the area.

2
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:19,849
He inserts a new record of the incident into his object view table.

3
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:25,437
Since he has no more information at the moment, he doesn't take any other action.

4
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:32,135
The incident is automatically added to the current state descriptor.

5
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:37,542
The state descriptor also contains current states of all field units

6
00:00:37,542 --> 00:00:42,462
and is shared in real time by both the Sensemaker and Commander.

7
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:49,585
25 minutes later, the Sensemaker receives reports about people injured in Town1 and Town2.

8
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:55,630
Again, he inserts corresponding records into his object view table

9
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,857
and the state descriptor is updated.

10
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:22,853
Next, the Sensemaker creates two activities "treat injuries in Town1 and 2" and passes them to the Commander.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,458
The Commander receives these activities immediately.

12
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:50,500
Before executing them, he orders to take aerial snapshots of the affected areas.

13
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:04,000
He passes the corresponding commands to subordinate field units.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,500
Using HTN planning (I-Plan), CNP negotiation and the commitment mechanism, field units generate and execute a distributed plan.

15
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,000
They report completion of the task back to the Commander.

16
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:30,261
Based on the received snapshots, the Commander decides to build a mobile hospital nearby Town1 and 2.

17
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,953
He issues a corresponding command for the field units.

18
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:45,611
Once again, the field units come up with a distributed plan.

19
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:51,193
They transport construction materials and a builder to the site,

20
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:04,288
and a mobile hospital is built there.

21
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:13,264
Upon completion of the task, the Commander executes the two treat injuries commands.

22
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:25,301
Medical material and medics are transported to the sites.

23
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:47,861
As usual, task completion is reported to the Commander.

24
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:56,201
Since these two tasks were originally created by the SenseMaker, he is also automatically notified about the tasks completion.

25
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:05,240
Approximately an hour later, the Sensemaker eceives a report about collapsed houses in Town3.

26
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,530
He inserts a new record into his object view table.

27
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:23,251
He then passes a new task "build houses in Town3" to the Commander.

28
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:39,239
The Commander receives this task and executes it.

29
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:45,780
Field units take care of the task.

30
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:15,619
Successful completion of the task is reported to the Commander and is also propogated to the Sensemaker.
