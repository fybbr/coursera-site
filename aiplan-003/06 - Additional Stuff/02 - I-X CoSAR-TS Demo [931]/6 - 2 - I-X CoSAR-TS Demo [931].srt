1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,136
This is description of the Coalition 
Search and Rescue Task Support Project. 

2
00:00:09,136 --> 00:00:14,508
Which is funded by the DARPA DAML Program 
And it's conducted by AIAI [UNKNOWN] and 

3
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:20,205
IHMC at University of West Florida. 
So we're initially showing you the CoABS 

4
00:00:20,205 --> 00:00:24,096
grid manager. 
And you can see that there's a number of 

5
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:29,211
services which are running. 
in particular, there'll be a JINI lookup 

6
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:32,597
service. 
And a number of other services running 

7
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:37,569
directly on the CoABS grid. 
Using KAoS for my IHMC and this provides 

8
00:00:37,569 --> 00:00:41,891
a directer service. 
And we're running a domain manager named 

9
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:44,801
dm1. 
We then have two IX process panels 

10
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:47,995
running. 
CoSAR TS for the coalition search and 

11
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:51,255
rescue panel. 
And US-SAR for the US search and rescue 

12
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:54,058
panel. 
And we have two services running for 

13
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:57,317
information lookup, called hospitals and 
resources. 

14
00:00:57,317 --> 00:01:02,532
Four agent guides are running, which help 
us to maintain policy across the use of 

15
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:06,770
these agents. 
Now we have, KAoS policy administration 

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,502
tool, which is helping us set up and 
maintain these policies. 

17
00:01:11,502 --> 00:01:17,652
So we have one domain which is running, 
mini coalition, within this is the four 

18
00:01:17,652 --> 00:01:23,251
agency or previously, CoSAR, US-SAR and 
then the two services, hospitals and 

19
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:28,224
resources. 
We're interested in limiting the kinds of 

20
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:33,394
search and rescue resources which can be 
chosen, depending on the flights that 

21
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:38,167
these resources would have to make. 
The countries that they will overfly. 

22
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:43,205
So we're going to establish a new KPAT 
policy, which we're going to call 

23
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:48,545
gao-flight-restriction. 
This is going to be a negative 

24
00:01:48,545 --> 00:01:54,287
authorization policy. 
We'll choose from one of the available 

25
00:01:54,287 --> 00:02:03,045
actions available to us, and select that. 
And within this slighted action we have 

26
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:09,754
an available roll of has on country. 
In this case, we're interested in placing 

27
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:19,691
a restriction on a country, which is Gao 
And then we can add that as part of the 

28
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:24,969
policy specification. 
That we have, we have home country Gao. 

29
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:29,224
Then there's going to be a second part of 
this policy. 

30
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:35,605
Which is the country that we won't permit 
overflights of Gaoen search and rescue 

31
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:39,684
resources too. 
So we'll say has rescue destination in 

32
00:02:39,684 --> 00:02:45,715
this case a limitation will be on the 
contrary so basically Gaoen search and 

33
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:51,981
rescue resources can not overfly arbelo 
so you can see that we've got two parts 

34
00:02:51,981 --> 00:03:06,148
policy specification there. 
And then we commit that policy and then 

35
00:03:06,148 --> 00:03:24,435
we want to distribute it. 
So, we'll just show you now the four 

36
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:31,078
agents once more within the KPAT tool. 
And we can show you that for the 

37
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:34,260
resources, agent we have that policy in 
place. 

38
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,709
So we're now going to move over to show 
you the two process panels which are 

39
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,201
available. 
The coalition search and rescue 

40
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:47,890
coordinator is going to be where most of 
the action in the demonstration takes 

41
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,916
place. 
And then we're going to use a US-SAR 

42
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:55,782
officer panel to initiate the action, 
because they would have taken the initial 

43
00:03:55,782 --> 00:03:59,224
report about the downed airman because 
he's a US national. 

44
00:03:59,224 --> 00:04:04,447
So in this case the US-SAR officer is 
told to send any reports of downed airman 

45
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:08,720
up to the coalition search and rescue 
coordinator for their activity. 

46
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,758
So, we'll take a look at the actions 
available to us at the process panel can 

47
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:18,429
support. 
And we see there that's there's a way to 

48
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:22,845
expand the description of this activity 
is a particular built in standard 

49
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:26,062
operating procedure. 
And we get the expansion, which is five 

50
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:28,842
substeps here. 
We now look, take a look at the first 

51
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:31,350
part. 
And we see a way to break that down even 

52
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,804
further. 
You can see the indented sub process. 

53
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:37,784
And we're going to look at the first part 
of that, which is to establish the 

54
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:44,726
medical capability. 
Now, in this case, we know that we've got 

55
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:50,404
a burned Ammon So we're going to use burn 
care as the medical facility capabilities 

56
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:53,410
we're looking up. 
And then we're able to indicate that 

57
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,694
we've done that manually. 
Then we're going to use a service 

58
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:59,644
available to us. 
This is one of the services which is 

59
00:04:59,644 --> 00:05:02,538
registered. 
So we can invoke the hospital service to 

60
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:06,101
establish medical care, 
establish the hospitals we have that can 

61
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:11,133
deal with burn capabilities. 
We're just showing you here that we know 

62
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:14,247
about hospitals and indeed resources as a 
service. 

63
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:19,603
This is in the ice base two which 
described services and in relationships 

64
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:26,094
in that particular panel. 
So we're going to invoke the hospital 

65
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:29,115
service agent and it's going to now be 
acting. 

66
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:33,842
You can see it there it's already going 
off and looking for, downloading 

67
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:38,569
information from the, SONAT database 
about Arabello and Binni in this case. 

68
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:43,624
And it's checked, finding hospitals, and 
that it's filtering those by the ones 

69
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:48,407
that can provide burdened care. 
We can take a look at that. 

70
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:52,701
We can look at the details, look at the 
kinds of hospitals available, where they 

71
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:55,636
are and so on. 
Find out that some can deal with a burn 

72
00:05:55,636 --> 00:06:00,760
carriage can see. 
GahwadEl looks like a likely candidate. 

73
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,493
We're going to, be interested in exactly 
where the hospital is in relationship to 

74
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:12,321
the downed hammond. 
So we can perhaps best do that by looking 

75
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:16,217
at a map of the facility. 
This would be loaded from the information 

76
00:06:16,217 --> 00:06:20,170
known to the IX process panel. 
You can see the pilot down in the sea 

77
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,193
there. 
And his condition report is in burns. 

78
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:25,868
And you can also see the GahwardEl 
Hospital. 

79
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:29,880
which, as we noted before is, is, has 
burned care facilities available. 

80
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,640
So we're going to go ahead and slight 
that hospital by binding the variable 

81
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:54,020
appropriately. 
And we can just tick that off as done. 

82
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,607
And then we're going to look at the next 
entry, which has established the country 

83
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:00,308
that, that hospital is in. 
You can imagine this being done more 

84
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:03,231
automatically in future. 
In this case we're going to indicate that 

85
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:06,774
it's Arabello because that's what was 
indicated in the information that came 

86
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:11,130
back in the look up. 
So now, that we've got our hospital 

87
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,158
available, we're interested in selecting 
the search and rescue results appropriate 

88
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:19,567
to the task. 
And we have a built in standard operating 

89
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:24,141
procedure to remind us how to do this. 
And in particular the first one is to, 

90
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:29,738
look up the SAR resources available which 
is going to invoke a resources agent. 

91
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:34,672
This will use a soap connection over to a 
CMU matchmaker, which finds these 

92
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:42,761
appropriate search and rescue resources. 
And we're finding some resources coming 

93
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:47,461
back, and in fact only resources that are 
allowed for all flights of arabello are 

94
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:52,046
going to come back so chaos has already 
been filtering the number of resources 

95
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:54,309
found. 
This case there are two that are 

96
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:58,487
permitted and seem well to do the job and 
we're going to choose the U.S. 

97
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:02,840
Marine helicopter that's convenient. 
It's in the right sort of location and 

98
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,857
it's also helps us deal with the fact 
this is a U.S. 

99
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:08,585
Airman down. 
So we're going to indicate that we 

100
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:10,618
selected that resource. 
By. 

101
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:13,670
Oh. 
We, we'll look at the map first just to 

102
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,940
show you where that U.S. 
Marine helicopter is. 

103
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:29,303
So we're now going to show you we can. 
Bind the variable for the SAR results 

104
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:32,570
selected. 
The US Marine helicopter. 

105
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,002
And again we'll indicate we've done that. 
Again you can imagine in the future much 

106
00:08:37,002 --> 00:08:39,489
of this could be done in a more automated 
way. 

107
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:43,760
And then we're going to notify the SAR 
resource itself, this would best be done 

108
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,949
by talking with the U.S. 
SAR officer who would control that 

109
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:51,166
resource so that it goes back onto the 
process panel and when they themselves 

110
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:55,437
have notified the helicopter pilot they 
would indicate it's done and you would 

111
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:58,037
see that the, 
the, there's a cascade of done 

112
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:02,779
information done to excess information 
flying back up turning lue if we have not 

113
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:08,091
find the hospital and we just going to 
check what the outstanding issue was that 

114
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:12,392
we're ask to just check it, as we went 
along, and yes the country and SAR 

115
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:17,198
resource chose nar allowed to get the, 
and that was in fact constrained by the 

116
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:20,360
KPAT policy. 
So that concludes are demonstration. 

117
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,520
Further information is available at some 
of the URL's now being shown. 

118
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,100
Thank you for watching the demonstration 
of the course RTX project.
