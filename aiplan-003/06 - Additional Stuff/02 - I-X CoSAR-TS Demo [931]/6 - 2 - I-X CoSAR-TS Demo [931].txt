This is description of the Coalition 
Search and Rescue Task Support Project. 
Which is funded by the DARPA DAML Program 
And it's conducted by AIAI [UNKNOWN] and 
IHMC at University of West Florida. 
So we're initially showing you the CoABS 
grid manager. 
And you can see that there's a number of 
services which are running. 
in particular, there'll be a JINI lookup 
service. 
And a number of other services running 
directly on the CoABS grid. 
Using KAoS for my IHMC and this provides 
a directer service. 
And we're running a domain manager named 
dm1. 
We then have two IX process panels 
running. 
CoSAR TS for the coalition search and 
rescue panel. 
And US-SAR for the US search and rescue 
panel. 
And we have two services running for 
information lookup, called hospitals and 
resources. 
Four agent guides are running, which help 
us to maintain policy across the use of 
these agents. 
Now we have, KAoS policy administration 
tool, which is helping us set up and 
maintain these policies. 
So we have one domain which is running, 
mini coalition, within this is the four 
agency or previously, CoSAR, US-SAR and 
then the two services, hospitals and 
resources. 
We're interested in limiting the kinds of 
search and rescue resources which can be 
chosen, depending on the flights that 
these resources would have to make. 
The countries that they will overfly. 
So we're going to establish a new KPAT 
policy, which we're going to call 
gao-flight-restriction. 
This is going to be a negative 
authorization policy. 
We'll choose from one of the available 
actions available to us, and select that. 
And within this slighted action we have 
an available roll of has on country. 
In this case, we're interested in placing 
a restriction on a country, which is Gao 
And then we can add that as part of the 
policy specification. 
That we have, we have home country Gao. 
Then there's going to be a second part of 
this policy. 
Which is the country that we won't permit 
overflights of Gaoen search and rescue 
resources too. 
So we'll say has rescue destination in 
this case a limitation will be on the 
contrary so basically Gaoen search and 
rescue resources can not overfly arbelo 
so you can see that we've got two parts 
policy specification there. 
And then we commit that policy and then 
we want to distribute it. 
So, we'll just show you now the four 
agents once more within the KPAT tool. 
And we can show you that for the 
resources, agent we have that policy in 
place. 
So we're now going to move over to show 
you the two process panels which are 
available. 
The coalition search and rescue 
coordinator is going to be where most of 
the action in the demonstration takes 
place. 
And then we're going to use a US-SAR 
officer panel to initiate the action, 
because they would have taken the initial 
report about the downed airman because 
he's a US national. 
So in this case the US-SAR officer is 
told to send any reports of downed airman 
up to the coalition search and rescue 
coordinator for their activity. 
So, we'll take a look at the actions 
available to us at the process panel can 
support. 
And we see there that's there's a way to 
expand the description of this activity 
is a particular built in standard 
operating procedure. 
And we get the expansion, which is five 
substeps here. 
We now look, take a look at the first 
part. 
And we see a way to break that down even 
further. 
You can see the indented sub process. 
And we're going to look at the first part 
of that, which is to establish the 
medical capability. 
Now, in this case, we know that we've got 
a burned Ammon So we're going to use burn 
care as the medical facility capabilities 
we're looking up. 
And then we're able to indicate that 
we've done that manually. 
Then we're going to use a service 
available to us. 
This is one of the services which is 
registered. 
So we can invoke the hospital service to 
establish medical care, 
establish the hospitals we have that can 
deal with burn capabilities. 
We're just showing you here that we know 
about hospitals and indeed resources as a 
service. 
This is in the ice base two which 
described services and in relationships 
in that particular panel. 
So we're going to invoke the hospital 
service agent and it's going to now be 
acting. 
You can see it there it's already going 
off and looking for, downloading 
information from the, SONAT database 
about Arabello and Binni in this case. 
And it's checked, finding hospitals, and 
that it's filtering those by the ones 
that can provide burdened care. 
We can take a look at that. 
We can look at the details, look at the 
kinds of hospitals available, where they 
are and so on. 
Find out that some can deal with a burn 
carriage can see. 
GahwadEl looks like a likely candidate. 
We're going to, be interested in exactly 
where the hospital is in relationship to 
the downed hammond. 
So we can perhaps best do that by looking 
at a map of the facility. 
This would be loaded from the information 
known to the IX process panel. 
You can see the pilot down in the sea 
there. 
And his condition report is in burns. 
And you can also see the GahwardEl 
Hospital. 
which, as we noted before is, is, has 
burned care facilities available. 
So we're going to go ahead and slight 
that hospital by binding the variable 
appropriately. 
And we can just tick that off as done. 
And then we're going to look at the next 
entry, which has established the country 
that, that hospital is in. 
You can imagine this being done more 
automatically in future. 
In this case we're going to indicate that 
it's Arabello because that's what was 
indicated in the information that came 
back in the look up. 
So now, that we've got our hospital 
available, we're interested in selecting 
the search and rescue results appropriate 
to the task. 
And we have a built in standard operating 
procedure to remind us how to do this. 
And in particular the first one is to, 
look up the SAR resources available which 
is going to invoke a resources agent. 
This will use a soap connection over to a 
CMU matchmaker, which finds these 
appropriate search and rescue resources. 
And we're finding some resources coming 
back, and in fact only resources that are 
allowed for all flights of arabello are 
going to come back so chaos has already 
been filtering the number of resources 
found. 
This case there are two that are 
permitted and seem well to do the job and 
we're going to choose the U.S. 
Marine helicopter that's convenient. 
It's in the right sort of location and 
it's also helps us deal with the fact 
this is a U.S. 
Airman down. 
So we're going to indicate that we 
selected that resource. 
By. 
Oh. 
We, we'll look at the map first just to 
show you where that U.S. 
Marine helicopter is. 
So we're now going to show you we can. 
Bind the variable for the SAR results 
selected. 
The US Marine helicopter. 
And again we'll indicate we've done that. 
Again you can imagine in the future much 
of this could be done in a more automated 
way. 
And then we're going to notify the SAR 
resource itself, this would best be done 
by talking with the U.S. 
SAR officer who would control that 
resource so that it goes back onto the 
process panel and when they themselves 
have notified the helicopter pilot they 
would indicate it's done and you would 
see that the, 
the, there's a cascade of done 
information done to excess information 
flying back up turning lue if we have not 
find the hospital and we just going to 
check what the outstanding issue was that 
we're ask to just check it, as we went 
along, and yes the country and SAR 
resource chose nar allowed to get the, 
and that was in fact constrained by the 
KPAT policy. 
So that concludes are demonstration. 
Further information is available at some 
of the URL's now being shown. 
Thank you for watching the demonstration 
of the course RTX project.
