00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,129
Hello everyone.
This is a video lecture recorded for the

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:10,390
artificial intelligent planning course in
the online learning community of Coursera.

3
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:16,121
The topic of this talk is how to use AI
Planning in. Medicine. Okay, something

4
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:21,420
about me before starting. I got my PhD in
Computer Science less than two years ago

5
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:26,497
in the University of Granada, Spain. I
develop several knowledge engineering

6
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:31,383
techniques for modeling, planning and
scheduling domains, using the HTN

7
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:37,114
paradigm. And I used these, techniques in
three different domains, e-learning,

8
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:41,869
healthcare. And business process
management. Now, I am doing a Postdoc

9
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:46,800
research and fellowship in the University
of Haifa in Israel and I'm working in a

10
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:51,681
very interesting project called MobiGuide,
which is aimed to create a clinical

11
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:56,791
decision support system for physicians and
patients to manage the care process of two

12
00:00:56,803 --> 00:01:02,592
different diseases, gestational diabetes
and atrial fibrillation and the idea is to

13
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:09,517
use this system anytime and everywhere. So
I will start showing several applications

14
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:15,647
in the real world of how to use a planning
in the domain of medicine. So one example

15
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,528
is how to schedule the beds that are
needed in a hospital for all the patients

16
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:28,105
that come here on a daily basis. Another
example is how to use AI planning for

17
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:35,100
conducting clinical trial protocols and
complying with all the requirements that

18
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:41,811
are specified in those protocols. AI
planning has been used also, to control

19
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:48,681
the state Of patients in intensive-care
units. It also has been used to evaluate

20
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:55,022
the risk and the consequences of a
specific treatment, improving the shared

21
00:01:55,034 --> 00:02:02,488
decision-making process between patients
and physicians. Finally, it has been used

22
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:09,667
to prepare treatment plans for the actions
that need to be carried out over a

23
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:17,345
patient. this topic is the center, the
focus of this talk, as you will see in a

24
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:24,691
few slides. But before people may think
that applying artificial intelligence to

25
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:31,601
medicine is not appropriate and many
people don't trust computer that much. So

26
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:38,139
I could show you some n numbers and, about
the estimation of medic al errors that are

27
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:45,546
commited by. Physicians. This is a report
of the history for medicine where between

28
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:52,424
44,000 and 98,000 deaths were estimated
each year inclusive U.S. Hospitals and 1

29
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:59,444
million injuries also are estimated each
year in these hospitals. Then follow-up

30
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:06,271
study found that medication errors are
among the most common medical Mistakes.

31
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:13,426
And they com, could harm at least 1.5
million people every year. So, it is clear

32
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:20,583
that physicians need support for the
actions, and medical scope. There is a

33
00:03:20,595 --> 00:03:28,015
relevant movement known as evidence-based
medicine. So this part, I'm try to collect

34
00:03:28,027 --> 00:03:33,855
the best evidence em, for treating
patients with specific conditions. Then a

35
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:39,085
set of experts collect all this
information and put them in narrative

36
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:45,095
clinical guidelines and protocols. They
use these guidelines and protocols. With

37
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:52,055
idea to, of improving equality of the,
care process. And to also to reduce the

38
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:58,100
deviations in the clinical practice,
according to this protocols, to guide the

39
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:03,950
collection of data, to interpret and
manage much better the patient's status.

40
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:11,491
And to improve the decision support. Of
course, if we are able to computerize this

41
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:18,369
knowledge, we can create system to out
activate alerts and reminders for the

42
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:25,640
physicians and the patients. So if, if we
Try to see how to use AI Planning for, for

43
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:32,100
planning the therapy of a patient. We'll
see that the requirements in this domain

44
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:38,585
are higher than in typical toy-problems.
and this is due to the unpredictable

45
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:44,827
nature of this domain. So in this domain
we will need several specific

46
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:51,166
sub-processes, not only plan generation,
but it's really, really important for the

47
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:56,992
safety of the patient to verify the plan.
of course we'll need to provide a

48
00:04:57,004 --> 00:05:03,538
visualization of the plan to execute the
plan, to modify the plan And finally the

49
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:11,364
plan critiquing, which is to analyse if
the plan being executed is, is, is

50
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:18,954
correct. So it has any problem regarding
the original knowledge. So there are

51
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:26,655
several challenges of course related to
these processes. one of the choices in

52
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:32,316
knowledge engineering, we need to, to
accompl ish the acquisition of knowledge

53
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:37,519
and the verification and validation. then
we have the temporary presentation of

54
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:42,282
management. Many different temporary
constraints are usually found in these

55
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:47,891
guidelines. Then another problem using
data integration we need to evaluate with

56
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:52,963
real data in the hospital data basis and
we need to integrate this into the

57
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:57,473
planning domain and of course the
exception handling due to this

58
00:05:57,485 --> 00:06:03,059
unpredictable nature, there are many cases
in which the human, the physician is to

59
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:10,187
Interact with the plan and needs to change
the plan according to a specific event

60
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:16,156
that has happened. Another important, or
one of the important issues is the

61
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:22,375
temporal monitoring. So this domain is
states, events, Events, actions, plans

62
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:28,805
goals, and effects, all of them are
constrained by temporal information. And

63
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:34,915
this makes monitoring and the states of an
events, during execution and very

64
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:41,870
necessary. Also the states model of a plan
engine may need to consider more than the

65
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:48,040
plan generation. So it could be needed to
suspend the plan or to check if it's

66
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:54,815
completed. what are the conditions for
aborting the plan and so, so it's not only

67
00:06:54,827 --> 00:07:01,745
plan generation. It's more dynamic and of
course the domain is not static and these

68
00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:08,354
unpredictable events Can occur, and this
depends really in, on your needs. Of

69
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:15,716
course in high frequency domains like
intensive care, care unit this is more

70
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:22,884
relevant. but there are also low frequency
domains where the physicians only want

71
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:28,540
Will have a plan of the treatment to
follow in the next eh, days. Another

72
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:34,415
important requirement is the management of
the care team view. So medicine is

73
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:41,035
supplied by the team of physicians nurses
and so on. So we have different roles, and

74
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:47,330
they use a number of resources for
accomplishing the treatment. For example,

75
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,425
x-ray machines. So the plans to be
generated from the clinical protocols may

76
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:59,332
need to consider these institutional
constraints and they should deliver a

77
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:05,691
personalized plan for patients, but also
for physicians. So we will explain very

78
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:12,823
quickly. a real project was carried out in
the so uth of Spain. It's called the

79
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:20,467
Oncotheraper. and here in this project,
the oncologists were required to apply

80
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,900
clinical guidance for treating. several
patients and this guy lands or protocols

81
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:32,375
in this case they have lot of temporary
constraints and they have all this

82
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:37,850
requirements that we talk about. Doing
what? To have a personalized care process

83
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:43,978
for patients and medical staff and they
want to reduce the time that they expand

84
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:48,776
on preparing this treatment. This is an
architecture that consider all the

85
00:08:48,788 --> 00:08:54,626
requirements that we talked about. So if
we start looking at the numbers of, inside

86
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:59,553
the boxes. we start on number one, on the
left hand side of the screen on the

87
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:04,802
bottom, we can see that clinicians are
responsible for the finding this narrative

88
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:10,316
guidance. Then, knowledge engineers
formalize this knowledge using what is

89
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:15,264
known as computer interpretative
algorithms, which are language to

90
00:09:15,276 --> 00:09:21,652
computerize this, knowledge. Then we have
a sic connector which is able to move from

91
00:09:21,664 --> 00:09:27,290
this formal knowledge to a planning
specification. For this, of course. We

92
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:32,840
need to include the connection with the
electronic health record from the

93
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:38,685
hospital, and the hospital information
system. Then, having this specification

94
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:44,075
created, and also considering all the
temporary constraints, we use a plan

95
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:49,754
generation engine Planner, in this case we
use Heirarchical Task Network planner, and

96
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:56,001
we generate a care pathway personalized
for the patient. This care pathway can be

97
00:09:56,013 --> 00:10:02,437
delivered in the form of a Gantt diagram
today physician so they can see a, all the

98
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:10,599
actions following specific Time for
recommendations and we can also deliver or

99
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:17,512
deploy, this care pathway using a business
process management engine. And, this is a

100
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:24,618
software tool possibly for an execute a
plan Remotely. And so each role is, is

101
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:32,196
each clinician or nurse can enter through
this portal and follow the plan. Of course

102
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:38,585
in number six we have another module which
is for repairing the plan and for

103
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:44,445
replanning. And this would be needed in
the cases we want to include the

104
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:50,745
management of unexpected event. So, wha t
do we get? Just a fragment of the care

105
00:10:50,757 --> 00:10:57,980
pathway that, that we can have as a result
of using this planning, technique, so we

106
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:05,282
have the start intended for each, step Eh,
the duration if is part of a higher level

107
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:12,428
chemotherapy cycle. The oncologist that
needs, needs to carry out the action. The

108
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,544
action itself, for example, the
administration of Prednisone, which is a,

109
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:25,197
a drug. The patient and the dosage of the
drug. On the bottom of the screen we can

110
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:31,578
see how to deploy this into a BPM engine
so that the physicians can ubiquitously

111
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:38,332
execute this plan. So this is all. Here in
the last slide you have a sound references

112
00:11:38,344 --> 00:11:44,747
that who should have, ha , try to read in
case that you have more interest in this

113
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:52,901
wonderful domain and I hope that you have
enjoyed the talk. And to enjoy also the

114
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:59,142
rest of the course. Thank you very much.
