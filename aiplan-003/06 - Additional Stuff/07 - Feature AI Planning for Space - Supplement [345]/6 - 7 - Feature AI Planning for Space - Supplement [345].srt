00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:10,101
Space missions and related areas have 
been a fruitful source of applications 

2
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:13,441
for AI planning over a long period of 
time. 

3
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:19,811
One of the earliest AI planners applied 
to spacecraft missions was Steve Veers De 

4
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:25,249
Visa planner created at NASA's Jet 
Propulsion Lab in the early 1980's. 

5
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:31,308
Optimum-AIV is a deployed planner used 
for Ariane rocket assembly, integration 

6
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:37,556
and test based on the old plan design. 
Applications have also included ground 

7
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:43,120
segment planning and control. 
Telecommand of meteorological satellites. 

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,211
Experiments in technology proving that in 
the control of autonomous space craft 

9
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:53,366
that a wide range of planners built at 
the European Space Agency and in NASA and 

10
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:56,800
we'll cover some of those in this 
feature. 

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,540
And the remote agent experiment within 
deep space one. 

12
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,279
Divisor created at NASA's jet propulsion 
laboratory by Steve Vair was the first 

13
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:11,869
NASA AI planner. 
As based on the nominally design, but 

14
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,340
added time window handling. 
It could produce Voyager mission plans. 

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,650
As part of our own work with the British 
National Space Centre on the TSat 

16
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,610
Technology Proving Satellite design The T 
sched-, scheduler was able to generate 

17
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,950
plans on the ground that were suitable 
for controlling the spacecraft. 

18
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,538
A 24-hour plan was created, uploaded and 
executed live onboard the UoSat-2 

19
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:43,405
spacecraft. 
In early work at the European Space 

20
00:01:43,405 --> 00:01:48,720
Agency, an AI planner for ERS one 
operation planning was created, and later 

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,250
modified to become the optimum AIV 
planner for assembly integration and test 

22
00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:02,194
of the paid load bay of Arian rockets. 
There are quite a range of projects in 

23
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:06,921
the European Space Agency that you AI 
planning methods, and a few of them are 

24
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:10,236
listed here. 
You can find more details on the European

Space Agency's space craft operation 
websites. 

26
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,280
Esa's project for on-board autonomy, 
Prober, has had a series of spacecraft 

27
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,697
which have demonstrated potential and 
feasibility small satellites with Van 

28
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:29,347
Syke scientific and Earth observation 
missions and some have been controlled by 

29
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:35,673
automated ground systems. 
Nasa also had a wide range of spacecraft 

30
00:02:35,673 --> 00:02:39,036
with AI planning embedded in them over 
the years. 

31
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:42,880
And some examples listed here, which is 
Aspen and Casper. 

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,053
More details of these projects are 
available at the NASA JPL, and NASARange 

33
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:55,084
websites. 
The NASA Mars exploration laboratory 

34
00:02:55,084 --> 00:03:00,236
Curiosity has been a target for a range 
of a I methods during its development 

35
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:04,793
stages and now in its operation. 
This has not only included the rover 

36
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:09,549
itself, but also the communications with 
it, spacecraft to support it, the 

37
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:14,503
operation centers which are used to 
control and communicate with the robot, 

38
00:03:14,503 --> 00:03:19,788
and even some of the proprietary work 
which has gone into the design simulation 

39
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:24,280
of the rovers and other equipment that's 
relevant to these missions. 

40
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,738
Take a moment to think about the 
curiosity mission. 

41
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:33,743
Imagine the opportunities for AI methods 
from its design and inception as a 

42
00:03:33,743 --> 00:03:37,497
mission right through to the launching of 
the spacecraft. 

43
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:41,580
The landing of the spacecraft on Mars. 
And then its operations.
