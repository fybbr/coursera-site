1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:07,682
>> What I still owe you is a definition
for mutual exclusivity, or mutex, between

2
00:00:07,682 --> 00:00:14,705
actions, and again, I will start by
illustrating this with an example.

3
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:20,323
We are looking at the same planning graph
as before here but now, our first layer,

4
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:26,050
we're looking at is the proposition layer
p1, that was on the right-hand side on the

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,946
previous graph.
So, we have p1, a2, and p2 in this graph

6
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:33,043
here.
And I'm sure you will remember from the

7
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:38,521
previous example that in proposition layer
p1, the propositions r1 and r2 were

8
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,593
incompatible.
So, they were mutex.

9
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:49,255
Now, we know that our proposition r1 is a
precondition for the action Lar1 in our

10
00:00:49,255 --> 00:00:54,925
action layer A2.
And the proposition r2 is a precondition

11
00:00:54,925 --> 00:01:00,469
for Mr21 in the same action layer.
And it should be clear to you that if

12
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:04,922
these two propositions that are
preconditions for these two actions are

13
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:09,868
mutually exclusive, so they cannot be true
in this proposition layer together.

14
00:01:09,868 --> 00:01:13,794
Then, the two actions cannot occur in the
following action layer.

15
00:01:13,794 --> 00:01:17,200
So, these two actions must be mutually
exclusive here.

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,318
So, what we've seen now, is that mutual
exclusivity between actions can lead to

17
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:27,866
mutual exclusivity between propositions,
in the following proposition layer and the

18
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:31,747
other way around.
Mutual exclusivity between propositions

19
00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:35,673
can lead to mutual exclusivity in the
following action layer.

20
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:43,157
And now, we can formally define what it
means for two actions in the same action

21
00:01:43,157 --> 00:01:49,521
layer to be mutually exclusive.
And this definition is quite simple.

22
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:56,157
We can say that two actions, a1 and a2,
that are in the same action layer, Aj, are

23
00:01:56,157 --> 00:02:00,553
mutex if one of the following two
conditions holds.

24
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:06,322
Firstly, if a1 and a2 are dependent.
So, if the dependency we've defined

25
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:11,101
earlier holds between these two actions,
then they're also mutex.

26
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:15,314
Or a precondition of a1 is mutex with a
precondition of a2.

27
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:20,845
If there are preconditions that are
mutually exclusive, then the two actions

28
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:25,556
are also mutually exclusive.
And these are the only two reasons why two

29
00:02:25,556 --> 00:02:29,334
actions in the same action layer are maybe
mutually exclusive.

30
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:33,534
Note that the first of these two
conditions is problem-independent, so

31
00:02:33,534 --> 00:02:38,364
dependency does not need to be recomputed
for each action layer Aj, it's always the

32
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:41,193
same whether two actions are dependent or
not.

33
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:45,684
Whereas, the second condition does depend
on the action layer in which the two

34
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:50,376
actions are because we're referring to
preconditions which are propositions in

35
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:55,402
the preceding proposition layer.
And now, again, a bit of notation.

36
00:02:55,402 --> 00:03:00,508
I want to introduce the set mu Aj which
we've already used in the previous

37
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:05,948
algorithm, which is the set of all pairs,
a1, a2, in an action layer Aj that are

38
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:09,045
mutex.
So, these are all the mutex pairs of

39
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:13,361
actions in a given action layer, namely
the action layer Aj.

40
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:19,196
And I can now tell you that in the example
we've just looked at, in the action layer

41
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:25,025
a2, there were actually 24 mutex pairs of
actions that may help you to understand

42
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:30,892
why I'm not drawing these mutex links into
the graph every time I draw the graph.

43
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:36,082
And a final remark about the mutex
relation and this applies to propositions

44
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:39,371
as well as actions, this relation is
symmetric.

45
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:44,477
So, if a1 is mutex to a2, then a2 must
also be mutex to a1 and again, the same

46
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:48,967
goes for propositions.
And again, for those of you who prefer an

47
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:54,511
algorithm to a definition, here comes an
algorithm is pseudo code defining the

48
00:03:54,511 --> 00:04:00,307
function mutex for a given pair of actions
and the set of mutex proposition pairs in

49
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:05,528
the preceding propositions there.
And in this algorithm, we simply were,

50
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:10,754
test what we've just defined, namely, the
first thing we do is we test whether the

51
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:16,058
two actions are not independent, so if
these two actions are dependent, then they

52
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:19,025
are also mutex, which means we return,
true.

53
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:24,573
Otherwise, we have to look for a pair of
preconditions of a1 and a2 respectively.

54
00:04:24,573 --> 00:04:30,155
And these are the preconditions p1 and p2
and see whether these preconditions are

55
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:33,538
mutually exclusive.
So, if we find such a pair of

56
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:39,431
preconditions for these two actions that
are mutually exclusive, then we know these

57
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:45,015
two actions are also mutually exclusive.
If we cannot find such a pair and the two

58
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:50,742
actions are independent, then we return
false, meaning, a1 and a2 are not mutually

59
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:53,853
exclusive.
As for the time complexity of the

60
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:57,141
algorithm, you can see it consists of two
parts.

61
00:04:57,141 --> 00:05:02,417
So, we have the time complexity of the
first part plus the complexity of the

62
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:06,755
second part.
And this is simply O of b squared, where b

63
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:12,861
is the maximum number of preconditions and
the fact we have per action.

64
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:18,648
Now, that we understand what mutex
relations are and how to compute them, I

65
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:24,879
want to see how mutex relations propagate
through the planning graph and that is

66
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,074
quite important.
So, we have two propositions here that

67
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:33,955
tell us how mutex relations propagate
through the planning graph.

68
00:05:33,955 --> 00:05:39,878
And the first one says that if we have a
pair, p,q that is in our proposition

69
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:45,892
layer, Pj minus 1, and they are not
mutually exclusive in that layer, then,

70
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:52,197
this same pair of propositions will also
be not mutually exclusive in the next

71
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:56,934
proposition there.
This means, once a pair of propositions

72
00:05:56,934 --> 00:06:02,700
that has appeared as mutex in the planning
graph, once this pair has become

73
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,416
non-mutex, it can never become mutex again
in a later layer.

74
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:12,777
So, the mutex relations are, in some
sense, decreasing the further down the

75
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:16,678
planning graph we go.
And to see that this is true is actually

76
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:19,634
quite simple.
So, we assume that p and q are in our

77
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:23,842
proposition layer Pj minus 1.
And, of course, that we means we have the

78
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:27,960
no-op operations for these two
propositions in the following action

79
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,714
layer.
And we have assumed that the propositions,

80
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:35,236
p and q, are not mutex in that proposition
layer.

81
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:40,512
So, that means the two no-op operations
are also not mutex in their action layer.

82
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:45,747
And that, of course, means we have a
non-mutex pair of actions that produce p

83
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:50,727
and q in the next proposition layer and
that means they can't be mutually

84
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:54,567
exclusive.
And we have a similar proposition from the

85
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:59,481
mutex relation between actions.
Namely, that if two actions are in one

86
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:04,876
action layer and they are not mutex in
that action layer, then they are also not

87
00:07:04,876 --> 00:07:10,667
mutex in the following action layer.
And again, the reason for this is quite

88
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:14,402
simple.
So, if we are given that a1 and a2 are not

89
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:20,418
mutex in this action layer Aj minus 1,
then by definition, that means a1 and a2

90
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:26,286
must be independent, and the preconditions
cannot be mutex in Pj minus 1.

91
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:31,017
Now, I've already told you in the previous
proposition that because mutual

92
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:36,342
exclusivity between the preconditions
carries forward, the preconditions for the

93
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:41,592
actions in the next layer must also not be
mutex and, of course, action independence

94
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:44,901
is constant.
So, what this means is both of these

95
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:49,861
properties remain true for the next
proposition there, and hence, our two

96
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:53,366
actions remain independent and therefore,
mutex.

97
00:07:53,366 --> 00:07:59,067
So, this is a very important property of
the mutex relation that it's decreasing

98
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:03,411
with increasing layer.
That's true for propositions and for

99
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:06,483
actions, and we will get back to that
later.

100
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:12,582
Now, before we move on with the graph plan
system, there is one further refinement to

101
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:16,283
the planning graph that I want to
introduce to you.

102
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:21,899
And this is actually quite simple, now
that you understand the mutex relations

103
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:26,683
between propositions.
So, suppose we have two propositions, p

104
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:32,016
and q, that are mutex, and that are
preconditions for the same action.

105
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:38,754
In this example here, we have the action
Uar2, and it has two preconditions, r2 and

106
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:45,171
ar, and they are mutually exclusive.
That, of course, means that we can never

107
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:49,162
execute that action Uar2 in that action
layer.

108
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:56,342
And what we do in this case is simply
remove the node that represents that

109
00:08:56,342 --> 00:09:01,261
action and all its edges from our planning
graph.

110
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:05,735
We remove Uar2 from A2.
It's as simple as that.
