00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,160
>> As I have told you before, the graph
plan planner performs two types of

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,072
operations.
The first is forward planning graph

3
00:00:10,072 --> 00:00:13,781
expansion, which is what we've looked at
so far.

4
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:18,750
And the second is, a backward search
through the planning graph.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,242
This backward search is what we're going
to look at next, although I probably don't

6
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:29,930
have to describe this to you.
I could just say that this is a depth

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:35,588
first graph search, where the search nodes
are subsets of nodes from the different

8
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:38,552
layers.
But, for those of you that find that a

9
00:00:38,552 --> 00:00:44,522
little superficial, here comes the detail.
And here is an overview of the search

10
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:50,465
procedure followed by graph plan.
We start by searching backwards from the

11
00:00:50,465 --> 00:00:54,169
last proposition layer in our planning
graph.

12
00:00:54,169 --> 00:01:00,730
Of course, this layer Pk, must contain all
the goal propositions, and none of these

13
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:06,224
goal propositions must be mutex.
Otherwise, the planning graph cannot

14
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:10,545
contain a solution plan.
So, this is where we start the search and

15
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:15,443
the remaining three steps describe how we
proceed with the search from any

16
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:19,565
proposition layer.
So, we assume that g are the current set

17
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:25,314
of goal propositions that we're trying to
achieve in a given proposition layer Pj.

18
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:30,486
Initially, this is the last layer.
But, during the course of the algorithm,

19
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:33,549
this will move backwards through the
graph.

20
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:38,427
And what we do to achieve these
propositions in layer Pj is to look for a

21
00:01:38,427 --> 00:01:42,946
set of actions, pi j, that are a subset of
the actions in layer Aj.

22
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:48,130
So that's the layer before Pj.
And, of course, the actions that we're

23
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,720
looking for must together achieve all the
conditions in g, and they must not be

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,453
mutex.
Then, we can simply take the preconditions

25
00:01:57,453 --> 00:02:02,909
of all these actions as our new subgoal,
the new propositions that we try to

26
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:10,002
achieve in proposition layer Pj minus 1.
And, of course, the search ends when we've

27
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:15,659
reached the layer P0.
And here is an example of how this works

28
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:22,510
in the planning graph we've seen before.
We start with our original goal consisting

29
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,573
of two goal propositions in the last
proposition layer which is P3 in this

30
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:33,383
graph, and this layer does indeed contain
the two goal propositions and they are not

31
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:37,062
mutex here.
Then, we have to chose a set of non-mutex

32
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:41,907
actions in our action layer A3 that
together achieve all the goals in

33
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:46,717
proposition layer P3.
And the positive effect links tell us what

34
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:50,655
options we have here.
And in this case, it's quite simple.

35
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:55,365
We choose these two actions here.
Then, we can follow the preconditioned

36
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:59,303
links to identify the subgoals in our
proposition layer P2.

37
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:02,812
And these are those four subgoals as you
can see here.

38
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:07,855
So far, this corresponds to one iteration
in our search algorithm.

39
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:13,735
And now, we can continue as before, we use
the positive effect links to identify

40
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,073
actions in the next action layer which is
A2.

41
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:22,572
And we see here each of these propositions
can be achieved by one action.

42
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:27,694
But, remember this graph does not show the
no-op operations that should be in this

43
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:30,670
layer.
I just left them out to save some space.

44
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,806
So technically, there are two more ways of
achieving these two propositions here.

45
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:40,514
Namely using the no-op operations.
Taking them straight from the preceding

46
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:43,084
layer.
And that's what we will do here.

47
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:48,651
So, from the actions shown here, we select
those two and we also take the two no-op

48
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:52,715
operations to achieve our goal
propositions in layer P2.

49
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:58,159
Then, we can use the precondition links to
identify the next subgoal in layer P1.

50
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,592
So, these are the preconditions of all the
actions we have chosen, including the

51
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:08,825
no-op operations here for subgoals.
And that concludes the second iteration

52
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:12,187
through our search.
So now, we proceed as before.

53
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:17,542
We use the positive effect links to
identify the actions in action layer A1,

54
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:21,592
and we can also use some no-op operations
as shown here.

55
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:26,842
But in addition to the no-op operations,
we also need two of the actions listed

56
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:31,181
here, namely those two.
And again, we use the precondition links

57
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:35,606
to identify those propositions in layer P0
that we need to be true.

58
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:41,820
And, in fact, as you can see here, all six
of the propositions in layer P0 are

59
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,169
required for this problem.
So that means we have found a solution

60
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:52,306
plan in our planning graph.
And it is a layer plan consisting of those

61
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:57,850
two actions in action layer 1, those two
actions in action layer 2, and those two

62
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:02,563
actions in action layer 3.
That's the plan we have come up with, the

63
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:07,271
plan we have found through backwards
search in our planning graph.
