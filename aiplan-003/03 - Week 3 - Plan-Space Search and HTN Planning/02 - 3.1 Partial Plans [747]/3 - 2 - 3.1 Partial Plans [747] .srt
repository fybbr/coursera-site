1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,124
In this next segment you will learn about 
a completely different approach to the 

2
00:00:06,124 --> 00:00:10,072
planning problem. 
We will still use search to solve 

3
00:00:10,072 --> 00:00:16,073
planning problems, but we will consider a 
completely different search space. 

4
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:21,547
In this new search space we will be 
looking at, the search states will be 

5
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:25,270
partial plans. 
Partial plans simply consist of part of 

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,980
what we finally have in the solution 
plan. 

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,972
The components of the solution plan will 
be our partial plans. 

8
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:36,632
So let's have a look at what these 
partial plans, the search states in our 

9
00:00:36,632 --> 00:00:40,771
new problem will look like,. 
Just as a reminder, let's look at 

10
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:44,896
state-space search. 
What we did in state-space search is we 

11
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:49,150
searched through a graph of nodes 
representing world states. 

12
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,249
So the nodes were world states in our 
search. 

13
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:57,167
What this means is that if we were doing 
graph-search, the graph we were 

14
00:00:57,167 --> 00:01:02,087
generating while we're doing search looks 
exactly like the graph of the state 

15
00:01:02,087 --> 00:01:06,368
transition system. 
This is not the case for plan-space 

16
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:09,295
search, which is what we'll be looking at 
here. 

17
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:14,294
Here, we are searching through a graph of 
partial plans as I've already mentioned. 

18
00:01:14,294 --> 00:01:17,672
In this graph, the nodes are partially 
specified plans, 

19
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:21,212
so they're not complete plans that we can 
execute yet. 

20
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:26,511
And then we have arcs in our search space 
and these are plan refinement operations. 

21
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:31,167
They tell us how we can move between 
partially specified plans usually by 

22
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:34,612
refining them and adding more content to 
these plans. 

23
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:39,268
And finally we have a new concept of 
solution to planning problems namely 

24
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:44,258
partial-order plans in which the actions 
are not in a total order as we've seen 

25
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:47,811
previously. 
So remember, previously we have seen 

26
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:52,749
plans that consist of actions that are 
only in sequence after one another, 

27
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:58,083
but now we will also be looking at plans 
where actions can be in parallel, so they 

28
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:02,948
are partially ordered. 
If our goal was somewhere over here and 

29
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:08,903
we hadn't gotten there yet, this could 
actually be a partial plan that we 

30
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:13,413
encounter as a search node on our way to 
the goal state. 

31
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:19,083
So what is a partial plan? I'll now try 
to answer this question informally before 

32
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:23,647
I give you the formal definition. 
In the introduction to this course, I 

33
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:28,211
told you that the plan in general is a 
set of actions organized into some 

34
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:31,702
structure. 
In the kind of planning we've looked at 

35
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:34,727
so far, the structure was always a 
sequence, 

36
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:39,702
but this characterization of plans 
already gives us the first idea of what 

37
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:43,752
could be a partial plan. 
If a complete plan is a set of actions, 

38
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:48,877
then a partial plan could simply be a 
subset of those actions that are part of 

39
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:52,762
the complete plan, 
so not all the actions are in our plan. 

40
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:57,017
Also if in, our complete plan, the 
actions are organized into some 

41
00:02:57,017 --> 00:03:01,961
structure, then we could have a subset of 
the structure for our partial plan. 

42
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:06,905
In a sequence of actions, all actions are 
ordered with respect to each other. 

43
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:11,636
So again, we could drop some of the 
ordering constraints and have this as a 

44
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:16,935
partial set, a partial plan that does not 
contain all of the ordering constraints 

45
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:20,811
of the original plan. 
Also, in the planning algorithms we've 

46
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:25,371
looked at so far, we always had a reason 
for introducing actions into a plan, that 

47
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,590
is the rationale of introducing that 
action to the plan. 

48
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,986
In forward search we have considered 
those actions that were applicable and 

49
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:36,781
then in backward search we have 
considered those actions that are 

50
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:39,797
relevant. 
An action being relevant or applicable is 

51
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:42,962
the rationale for considering that action 
in a plan. 

52
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:47,872
If we had recorded that rationale as part 
of the plan, then we could drop it again 

53
00:03:47,872 --> 00:03:51,578
here and have a partial rationale as part 
of a partial plan. 

54
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:56,093
And finally, as part of the planning 
process, we have used operators and 

55
00:03:56,093 --> 00:04:00,069
turned them into actions. 
That means we've introduced variable 

56
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,236
bindings. 
We've assigned values to the parameters 

57
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:05,945
of the operators to turn them into 
actions. 

58
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:10,462
Now, we can use a subset of these 
variable bindings to create a partial 

59
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:13,442
plan. 
So this tells us there are four different 

60
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:18,582
ways of making a plan partial, namely by 
including only a subset of the actions, a 

61
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:23,462
subset of the temporal constraints, a 
subset of the rationale, or a subset of 

62
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:27,558
the variable bindings. 
Now, here is the formal definition of 

63
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:32,518
what constitutes a partial plan, and a 
partial plan is defined here as a four 

64
00:04:32,518 --> 00:04:37,504
tuple consisting of four components. 
It consists of actions, it consists of 

65
00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:42,795
ordering constraints, variable bindings, 
and causal links representing the 

66
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:47,987
rationale why actions are in the plan. 
So let's start with the first component, 

67
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:52,832
that's the set A of actions in the plan. 
In fact, these are partially instantiated 

68
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:55,917
planning operators, 
so we take planning operators. 

69
00:04:55,917 --> 00:05:00,607
We may bind some of the variables with 
values and those are our partial actions 

70
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:04,762
that we consider part of our plan. 
We have a set of these actions, not a 

71
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,782
sequence, 
so they are not necessarily ordered with 

72
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:10,252
respect to each other as part of this 
set. 

73
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:15,609
The ordering relations are maintained 
explicitly in this ordering relation, 

74
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:18,631
that is the second component of a partial 
plan. 

75
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:24,036
And the ordering relation consists of 
pairs of this form, ai before aj, simply 

76
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:29,399
saying that the action ai, which must be 
a member of our set A comes before the 

77
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,667
action aj in our plan that we're building 
up here. 

78
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:37,593
The third component of a variable 
bindings for the actions in our set A and 

79
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:42,192
these variable bindings tell us what 
values the variables can take. 

80
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:46,980
Variable binding constraints can be more 
general than just assigning a specific 

81
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,539
value to a variable. 
In fact, we will allow three different 

82
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:53,784
forms here, 
namely x=y saying that two variable must 

83
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:58,433
have the same value or x unequals y, 
meaning that the two variables must have 

84
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:01,992
a different value, 
or we can specify a domain for variable 

85
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:06,430
saying this variable must have a value 
from a given set of values. 

86
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,398
,, the fourth component are the causal 
links that are part of this plan and they 

87
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:17,707
are of the syntactic form here. 
They connect actions ai and action aj 

88
00:06:17,707 --> 00:06:22,093
through this proposition p. 
And here's what this all means. 

89
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:25,964
So ai and aj must be actions in our 
current partial plan. 

90
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:31,380
Also, the action ai, the first component 
must come before the second component, 

91
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,796
so we must have an ordering relation in 
our ordering constraints of this type ai 

92
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:41,237
before aj. 
Then, the proposition p must be an effect 

93
00:06:41,237 --> 00:06:47,317
of ai, so it is produced by ai and is a 
precondition of aj, which mean aj is 

94
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:53,057
consuming this proposition. 
That is why ai is called the producer in 

95
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:57,952
this causal link and aj the consumer of 
this proposition. 

96
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:02,279
The proposition p is the protected 
proposition as we are not trying to 

97
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,390
interfere with this proposition before aj 
can consume it. And finally, since these 

98
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,968
expressions all contain variables we've 
got to make sure that the binding 

99
00:07:11,968 --> 00:07:16,784
constraints for variables that we are 
using in ai, in aj and also appearing in 

100
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:21,672
p are consistent and are also appearing 
in our binding constraints the set B. 

101
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:26,927
So, in short, remember this, a partial 
plan is a four tuple consisting of 

102
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:32,852
actions, ordering constraints, variable 
bindings and causal links where a causal 

103
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:37,817
link connects a producer to a consumer 
via a protected proposition p. 

104
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:43,497
So that's what a partial plan looks like 
and the search nodes in our search space 

105
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:45,025
will be partial plans.
