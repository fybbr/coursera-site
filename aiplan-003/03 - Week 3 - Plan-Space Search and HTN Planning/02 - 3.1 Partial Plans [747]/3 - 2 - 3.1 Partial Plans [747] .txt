In this next segment you will learn about 
a completely different approach to the 
planning problem. 
We will still use search to solve 
planning problems, but we will consider a 
completely different search space. 
In this new search space we will be 
looking at, the search states will be 
partial plans. 
Partial plans simply consist of part of 
what we finally have in the solution 
plan. 
The components of the solution plan will 
be our partial plans. 
So let's have a look at what these 
partial plans, the search states in our 
new problem will look like,. 
Just as a reminder, let's look at 
state-space search. 
What we did in state-space search is we 
searched through a graph of nodes 
representing world states. 
So the nodes were world states in our 
search. 
What this means is that if we were doing 
graph-search, the graph we were 
generating while we're doing search looks 
exactly like the graph of the state 
transition system. 
This is not the case for plan-space 
search, which is what we'll be looking at 
here. 
Here, we are searching through a graph of 
partial plans as I've already mentioned. 
In this graph, the nodes are partially 
specified plans, 
so they're not complete plans that we can 
execute yet. 
And then we have arcs in our search space 
and these are plan refinement operations. 
They tell us how we can move between 
partially specified plans usually by 
refining them and adding more content to 
these plans. 
And finally we have a new concept of 
solution to planning problems namely 
partial-order plans in which the actions 
are not in a total order as we've seen 
previously. 
So remember, previously we have seen 
plans that consist of actions that are 
only in sequence after one another, 
but now we will also be looking at plans 
where actions can be in parallel, so they 
are partially ordered. 
If our goal was somewhere over here and 
we hadn't gotten there yet, this could 
actually be a partial plan that we 
encounter as a search node on our way to 
the goal state. 
So what is a partial plan? I'll now try 
to answer this question informally before 
I give you the formal definition. 
In the introduction to this course, I 
told you that the plan in general is a 
set of actions organized into some 
structure. 
In the kind of planning we've looked at 
so far, the structure was always a 
sequence, 
but this characterization of plans 
already gives us the first idea of what 
could be a partial plan. 
If a complete plan is a set of actions, 
then a partial plan could simply be a 
subset of those actions that are part of 
the complete plan, 
so not all the actions are in our plan. 
Also if in, our complete plan, the 
actions are organized into some 
structure, then we could have a subset of 
the structure for our partial plan. 
In a sequence of actions, all actions are 
ordered with respect to each other. 
So again, we could drop some of the 
ordering constraints and have this as a 
partial set, a partial plan that does not 
contain all of the ordering constraints 
of the original plan. 
Also, in the planning algorithms we've 
looked at so far, we always had a reason 
for introducing actions into a plan, that 
is the rationale of introducing that 
action to the plan. 
In forward search we have considered 
those actions that were applicable and 
then in backward search we have 
considered those actions that are 
relevant. 
An action being relevant or applicable is 
the rationale for considering that action 
in a plan. 
If we had recorded that rationale as part 
of the plan, then we could drop it again 
here and have a partial rationale as part 
of a partial plan. 
And finally, as part of the planning 
process, we have used operators and 
turned them into actions. 
That means we've introduced variable 
bindings. 
We've assigned values to the parameters 
of the operators to turn them into 
actions. 
Now, we can use a subset of these 
variable bindings to create a partial 
plan. 
So this tells us there are four different 
ways of making a plan partial, namely by 
including only a subset of the actions, a 
subset of the temporal constraints, a 
subset of the rationale, or a subset of 
the variable bindings. 
Now, here is the formal definition of 
what constitutes a partial plan, and a 
partial plan is defined here as a four 
tuple consisting of four components. 
It consists of actions, it consists of 
ordering constraints, variable bindings, 
and causal links representing the 
rationale why actions are in the plan. 
So let's start with the first component, 
that's the set A of actions in the plan. 
In fact, these are partially instantiated 
planning operators, 
so we take planning operators. 
We may bind some of the variables with 
values and those are our partial actions 
that we consider part of our plan. 
We have a set of these actions, not a 
sequence, 
so they are not necessarily ordered with 
respect to each other as part of this 
set. 
The ordering relations are maintained 
explicitly in this ordering relation, 
that is the second component of a partial 
plan. 
And the ordering relation consists of 
pairs of this form, ai before aj, simply 
saying that the action ai, which must be 
a member of our set A comes before the 
action aj in our plan that we're building 
up here. 
The third component of a variable 
bindings for the actions in our set A and 
these variable bindings tell us what 
values the variables can take. 
Variable binding constraints can be more 
general than just assigning a specific 
value to a variable. 
In fact, we will allow three different 
forms here, 
namely x=y saying that two variable must 
have the same value or x unequals y, 
meaning that the two variables must have 
a different value, 
or we can specify a domain for variable 
saying this variable must have a value 
from a given set of values. 
,, the fourth component are the causal 
links that are part of this plan and they 
are of the syntactic form here. 
They connect actions ai and action aj 
through this proposition p. 
And here's what this all means. 
So ai and aj must be actions in our 
current partial plan. 
Also, the action ai, the first component 
must come before the second component, 
so we must have an ordering relation in 
our ordering constraints of this type ai 
before aj. 
Then, the proposition p must be an effect 
of ai, so it is produced by ai and is a 
precondition of aj, which mean aj is 
consuming this proposition. 
That is why ai is called the producer in 
this causal link and aj the consumer of 
this proposition. 
The proposition p is the protected 
proposition as we are not trying to 
interfere with this proposition before aj 
can consume it. And finally, since these 
expressions all contain variables we've 
got to make sure that the binding 
constraints for variables that we are 
using in ai, in aj and also appearing in 
p are consistent and are also appearing 
in our binding constraints the set B. 
So, in short, remember this, a partial 
plan is a four tuple consisting of 
actions, ordering constraints, variable 
bindings and causal links where a causal 
link connects a producer to a consumer 
via a protected proposition p. 
So that's what a partial plan looks like 
and the search nodes in our search space 
will be partial plans.
