00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:08,376
Hi I'm David Wilkins I'm a Senior 
Computer Scientist at SRI International's 

2
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:16,614
Artificial Intelligence Center. 
SRI is a not for profit contract research 

3
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:23,442
institute in Silicone Valley. 
I got my PhD in Stanford in 1979. 

4
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:27,541
My adviser was John McCarthy, who taught 
my first list class. 

5
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:32,726
Immediately after graduating I moved 
across to El Camino, to SRI's AI center. 

6
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:37,906
Primarily because Nils Nilson was here 
and I wanted to work with him, My first 

7
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:42,817
boss at SRI was Earl Sacerdoti the author 
of NOAH before NOAH AI planning was 

8
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:47,919
generally search in a space space and 
NOAH introduced search in a planned space 

9
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:50,952
AI planning. 
Inspired by Earl and NOAHI became 

10
00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:56,173
interested in solving real world planning 
problems and found that this regard of 

11
00:00:56,173 --> 00:01:00,292
more domain knowledge and more expressive 
representations. 

12
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:03,129
I divide past research in AI findings in 
two camps. 

13
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,175
The first are systems that take a 
minimalist approach to main knowledge, 

14
00:01:07,175 --> 00:01:11,526
they use strip style descriptions of 
primitive actions, I call them primitive 

15
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:14,729
action planners. 
The second are the systems that focus on 

16
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,491
leveraging as much domain knowledge as 
possible. 

17
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:21,112
I use this approach in developing the 
sight planning system. 

18
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:24,443
System. 
On the first slide we'll see an example 

19
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:29,899
of one of the domains that site and coded 
for planning it's the response to oil 

20
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:33,309
spills. 
And in this picture we see several boats 

21
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:37,962
deploying boom around an island to 
protect it from an oil spill. 

22
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:42,960
The key point here is that there multiple 
boats executing this plan and that it's 

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,312
important to have a sufficient amount of 
boom to go around the island. 

24
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:52,404
On the next slide, we'll see a number of 
techniques I've developed to address real 

25
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,853
world problems. 
This list was driven by client needs to 

26
00:01:55,853 --> 00:01:59,139
solve their problems, not by any research 
attempts. 

27
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:03,993
Some of these techniques are now called 
hierarchical task network planning in 

28
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:07,769
SIPE known as an HTN planner. 
The first technique is multiple 

29
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,492
abstraction levels. 
Many real problems have distinct natural 

30
00:02:11,492 --> 00:02:15,174
attraction levels making them natural 
fits for HTN planning. 

31
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:19,484
These levels are a powerful way to 
control the search and they're a great 

32
00:02:19,484 --> 00:02:24,124
way to interact with humans because a 
primitive action strip style plan at the 

33
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:27,812
lowest level of detail can be very 
difficult to understand. 

34
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:33,127
Next item is parallel actions. 
Realistic domains generally have parallel 

35
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:38,707
agents executing activities at the same 
time and these agents must coordinate 

36
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:42,722
their activities. 
Parallelism can cause computational 

37
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:47,795
problems in AI planners and some AI 
Planning systems produce only sequential 

38
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:50,715
plans. 
Next is context dependent effects which 

39
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:55,399
are ubiquitous in real world problems. 
For example if you move an object to a 

40
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:59,097
new location all the objects attached to 
it are on top of or moved with it. 

41
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:04,039
So I could deduce these context-dependent 
effects where as an strip style planner, 

42
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:08,870
you would generally need a different 
operative for every possible combination 

43
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,747
of things that might be attached to the 
block. 

44
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:16,481
The next two items constraints and 
resources come from the fact that 

45
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:22,196
reasoning about numbers are essential to 
almost every realistic domain.Time is a, 

46
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:27,816
is certainly a key element in most plans. 
Resources also have a specific capacity 

47
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:31,258
or must be accumulated in, in certain 
quantities. 

48
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:36,522
An example of a goal in accumulation is 
obtaining the boom in the previous 

49
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:41,938
example a planner had to plan to obtain 
enough boom to surround the island and it 

50
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:46,656
had to reason about numbers to do that. 
SIPE developed heuristics and 

51
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:51,815
representations to efficiently reason 
about actions which we needn't go into 

52
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:57,049
detail here and the real world problems 
plans never executed as expected so you 

53
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,481
wanted to re-plan during execution to fix 
the plan. 

54
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:03,493
Many AI planners never address that 
problem. 

55
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:08,678
And finally, we found a need to have an 
interactive graphical user interface. 

56
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:13,802
SIPE had perhaps the most advanced GUI 
and AI planning in the 80s and 90s. 

57
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:18,679
Interacting with people is a critical 
aspect of real-world planning. 

58
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:23,971
Realistic problems are embedded in the 
world and aren't precisely defined. 

59
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:27,731
They have fuzzy edges. 
The person almost always knows 

60
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:32,995
information the planner doesn't and can 
use that to help make good choices. 

61
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:37,797
Another important reason to have the 
Gooey is that it helps the user 

62
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:41,372
understand the plan. 
A large plan full of primitive actions 

63
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:45,880
can be very difficult to understand. 
And the ability to use the abstraction 

64
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,662
levels and the Gooey and trail down and 
see network displays is very crucial. 

65
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:56,587
So in the next slide, we actually see a 
screenshot capturing part of an oil spill 

66
00:04:56,587 --> 00:05:02,452
response plan from the site, Gooey. 
We'll look at the top three nodes of this 

67
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:05,777
plan. 
And and the top right you see a Blue 

68
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:08,682
oval. 
Blue ovals represent primitive actions 

69
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:12,767
that are already in the plan. 
In this case the action is to deploy 

70
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:16,077
3,000 feet of boom to the Berkeley 
eelgrass at Time 3. 

71
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:21,802
This spill was in the San Francisco bay. 
Right before that is a aqua hexagon. 

72
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:28,315
They represent goals that need to be 
expanded at the next level of details. 

73
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:34,828
This particular goal was to get this 
3,000 feet of boom located at Berkley. 

74
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:38,162
So look at the goal immediately below 
this. 

75
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:43,487
It turns out that the higher level goal 
was to get 9,000 feet of Boom to Berkley. 

76
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:48,662
SIPE new of 3,000 feet of Boom in some 
locations so it split the goal into two. 

77
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:51,937
The first one was to get to 3.000 feet 
Feet there. 

78
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:56,216
And parallel I posted another goal to get 
the additional 6,000 feet of boom to 

79
00:05:56,216 --> 00:05:58,637
Berkely. 
The entire plan for this oil spill 

80
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:02,032
response had a few hundred notes when it 
was complete. 

81
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:06,359
And the next light I'll show you a brief 
overview of how sight produces plans. 

82
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:10,743
It has a representation of the state of 
the world which you see on the left side 

83
00:06:10,743 --> 00:06:13,287
of the slide. 
And that's for example where it 

84
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:17,357
represents the fact that it knows that 
there's 3,000 feet of boom in some 

85
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:20,682
warehouse somewhere. 
It then has operators that represent 

86
00:06:20,682 --> 00:06:25,408
actions, these are multiple levels of 
extraction they represent Things about 

87
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:30,571
how to transport boom and how to deploy 
it when you have goals and objectives 

88
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:35,026
you're trying to achieve. 
The plan generator then combines these 

89
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:40,442
and on the right side you see a depiction 
of how it applies these operators level 

90
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:44,137
after level to expand down to the most 
primitive plan. 

91
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:49,693
And when it finally gets a Plan composed 
of primitive actions then it's ready for 

92
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:55,235
execution and the plan executed will then 
take over, and if we plan in as needed it 

93
00:06:55,235 --> 00:07:00,626
will cycle back and give some new goals 
and give the new beliefs and constraints 

94
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:05,802
that represent the world. 
This concludes my description of the 

95
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:11,602
motivations behind sipe.

00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:21,042
Thanks very much for your attention.
