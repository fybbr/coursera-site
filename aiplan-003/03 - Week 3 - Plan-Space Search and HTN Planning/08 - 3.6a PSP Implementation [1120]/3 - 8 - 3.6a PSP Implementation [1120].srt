1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:06,197
What you have just seen is the overview 
of a generic plan space search planner. 

2
00:00:06,197 --> 00:00:11,531
The reason why we've looked for the 
overview first is so that you can 

3
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:18,262
recognize the generic search structure 
that underlies this algorithm. 

4
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:22,862
Now, we will look at some of the 
implementation details that come with 

5
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:27,687
this algorithm and that were hidden and 
the function used by the generic 

6
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:31,237
algorithm. 
The first function used by the plan space 

7
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:36,112
planner is the function that extracts the 
Opengoals from a given plan. 

8
00:00:36,112 --> 00:00:40,492
And instead of computing these open 
goals, afresh every time we go through 

9
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:45,257
the loop, we will do this incrementally. 
We start off with out initial plan pi 0, 

10
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:48,092
that has just the 2 dummy actions in it 
and goal. 

11
00:00:48,092 --> 00:00:52,432
And the question now is, what are the 
unachieved sub goals in this initial 

12
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:56,992
plan? And the answer is simply that these 
are the gold conditions that are the 

13
00:00:56,992 --> 00:01:02,419
pre-conditions of the goal dummy act. 
So our goal conditions from our planning 

14
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:05,914
problem are our initial unachieved 
sub-goals. 

15
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:10,190
Then we have to modify the set when we do 
one of two things. 

16
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:15,902
When we add an action to the plan we have 
add all the action's preconditions as 

17
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:20,937
unachieved sub-goals to our set. 
So we increase the set of unachieved 

18
00:01:20,937 --> 00:01:25,029
sub-goals every time we add an action to 
our partial plan. 

19
00:01:25,029 --> 00:01:30,223
And when we add a causal link we decrease 
the set of unachieved sub-goals. 

20
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:35,733
And we decrease it by the preposition 
that is now protected in this causal link 

21
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:40,602
and is no longer unachieved. 
This precondition of an action is not 

22
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:46,137
supported by a casual link and is no 
longer an unachieved sub goal.Next we 

23
00:01:46,137 --> 00:01:51,927
have to complete the threats that exist 
in our current partial plan and again 

24
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:58,092
we'll do this incrementally rather than 
compute them every time we go Through the 

25
00:01:58,092 --> 00:02:01,366
loop. 
And we start with our initial plan pi 0 

26
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:05,532
that simply contains no threat. 
So that is very easy to compute. 

27
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:08,277
The other cases are a little more 
complex. 

28
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:13,213
New threats can be introduced into our 
plan every time we add an action to our 

29
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:16,199
plan. 
So suppose we're adding our action A new 

30
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,016
to our plan consisting of the usual 
things. 

31
00:02:19,016 --> 00:02:23,382
Then what we have to do is follow this 
procedure to check whether. 

32
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:26,320
A new threat has been introduced with 
this action. 

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,713
The way we do this is we go through every 
causal link that is currently in our 

34
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:35,337
plan, and we have a loop variable here 
that represents this causal link as going 

35
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:40,011
from AI to AJ, protecting proposition P, 
and for every such link we have to check 

36
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:43,507
the following. 
The first one is, we check whether our 

37
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:46,982
new action is already ordered, before ai, 
or after aj. 

38
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:51,607
So if the new action, is before the 
provider, or after the consumer, that 

39
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:54,752
means it cannot be imparital, to our 
causal link. 

40
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:59,422
Which means, it cannot threaten that 
causal link, and we can just simply, 

41
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:02,217
continue with the loop, go to the next 
link. 

42
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:07,357
Otherwise that means the action can be in 
parallel to our link. 

43
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:13,482
It need necessarily but it can be. 
And then we have to check every effect q 

44
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:18,322
of our new action. 
And if there is such an effect q that can 

45
00:03:18,322 --> 00:03:22,137
be unified with p such that q and ~p are 
equal. 

46
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:28,667
q and p are complimentary then and only 
then is q of anew a threat for our causal 

47
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,754
link. 
Of course, this only applies if the 

48
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:36,503
substitution is actually consistent with 
out binding constraints. 

49
00:03:36,503 --> 00:03:41,196
So this was the case where a newly 
introduced action may threaten an 

50
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:46,246
existing causal link in our partial plan. 
The other way where we can add new 

51
00:03:46,246 --> 00:03:50,699
threats to our partial plan is when we 
add a causal link, from ai, to aj, 

52
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,098
protecting proposition p, to our current 
partial plan. 

53
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:57,011
And when we add this new causal link to 
the plan, 

54
00:03:57,011 --> 00:04:00,912
this may be threatened by any action that 
is already in the plan. 

55
00:04:00,912 --> 00:04:05,700
So what we've got to do is, we've got to 
loop over all the old actions in our plan 

56
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,220
that already existed in our plan. 
And check whether they pose of threat. 

57
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,657
Again, if this existing action is either 
before the provider or after the 

58
00:04:14,657 --> 00:04:17,520
consumer, then this action cannot be a 
threat. 

59
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,024
And there's a third condition here, 
namely that our existing action is the 

60
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:26,218
consumer in our causal link. 
Of course, the consumer of a causal link 

61
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:30,521
cannot threaten that causal link. 
So, if one of these three conditions 

62
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:35,041
hold, we can go on to the next action 
because this Existing action we're 

63
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:39,763
currently observing cannot possibly be a 
threat to the newly introduced causal 

64
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:42,389
link. 
Otherwise, we have to observe all the 

65
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,882
effects of our existing action, and do 
what we did before. 

66
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:50,340
We've got to see whether this is 
unifiable with our protected proposition, 

67
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,502
and if this is the case, if these two can 
be made complimentary by some 

68
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:59,249
substitution that is consistent with our 
binding constraints, then we have the 

69
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:04,497
case where we effect q of our existing 
action a old threatens are newly 

70
00:05:04,497 --> 00:05:09,012
introduced causal link from ai to aj 
protecting proposition p. 

71
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:14,557
In summary, we have no threats initially 
but every time we add an action to the 

72
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:19,947
plan that means we can threaten an 
existing causal link with this new action 

73
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:25,129
and every time we add a causal link to 
this plan to the partial plan then this 

74
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:29,343
may be threatened by an existing action 
that is already in the plan. 

75
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:34,090
Now that we have detected the two types 
of potential flaws that can exist in a 

76
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,743
partial plan we need to look at the 
function that can remove these flaws and 

77
00:05:38,743 --> 00:05:43,972
this is this function here getResolvers, 
the Resolver is a way of removing a flaw 

78
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:47,167
from a plan. 
And we will first look at the flaw that 

79
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:50,402
is an unachieved precondition in our 
partial plan. 

80
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:53,852
And we will consider the precondition p 
of action ag. 

81
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:58,498
And there are two principal ways in which 
this type of flaw can be removed from the 

82
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:02,678
plan and in which way can be resolved 
namely by adding a causal link and by 

83
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:07,135
adding a new action and a causal link. 
Let's start with the causal link along. 

84
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:11,000
This is a causal link to an existing 
action so what we going to do is see 

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,142
whether there is an existing action in 
our plan , so we go through all our 

86
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:19,549
existing actions in the plan to check 
whether there can be a provider for this 

87
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:23,607
unsupported pre-condition. 
The first condition then is that we have 

88
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:28,362
to make sure that our existing action can 
be ordered before the consumer, and the 

89
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:32,737
consumer, of course, is ag in this case. 
So, if our existing action is the 

90
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:37,477
consumer, or it is already ordered after 
the consumer, then we cannot use it as a 

91
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:42,297
provider, because it cannot come before 
the consumer, so we can just consider the 

92
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:46,304
next action. 
Otherwise, if it may come before the 

93
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:51,110
consumer, then we've got to check every 
effect q, of our existing action, to see 

94
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,793
whether this can be used as a provider. 
And again, what we do, is we try to find 

95
00:06:55,793 --> 00:07:00,999
the substitution, consistent with our 
variable binding constraints such that p 

96
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:04,937
and q are equal. 
If we can find such a substitution, then 

97
00:07:04,937 --> 00:07:09,368
adding a causal link to our plan, is a 
resolver for this thread. 

98
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:14,707
And the causal link we need to add is, 
from our currently existing action, to 

99
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:17,921
our consumer, protecting the link sigma 
of p. 

100
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:22,982
So we instantiate our proposition with 
the substitution we just found. 

101
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:27,428
This was the case where we used an 
existing action in our plan to provide 

102
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:32,426
support for an unachieved precondition. 
The alternative is, of course, that we 

103
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:37,443
introduce a new action into our plan that 
supports our unachieved precondition. 

104
00:07:37,443 --> 00:07:42,328
And to check whether this is possible, 
we've got to loop over all the operators 

105
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:47,257
in our planning domain and check every 
effect q of every operator to see whether 

106
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:52,083
this can be used as a provider The first 
step is, that we look for a substitution 

107
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:56,270
sigma, that makes p and q equal. 
Note that we don't have to worry about 

108
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:01,001
the variable binding constraints in this 
case, because all the variables in q, 

109
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:05,732
that we've just introduced with the new 
operator, are of course new variables, 

110
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:09,852
and have no bindings yet. 
If we find such an operator, then we use 

111
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:13,397
an instance of this operator as a new 
action in our plan. 

112
00:08:13,397 --> 00:08:16,617
So this is the new action we need to add 
to the plan. 

113
00:08:16,617 --> 00:08:21,452
And we also need to add a causal link to 
the plan and this causal link consists 

114
00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:24,266
of. 
The link from a new, the provider, the 

115
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:27,526
action we just introduced, to our 
consumer, ag. 

116
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:33,007
And again we protect the condition sigma 
of p, the instantiated proposition, that 

117
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:38,192
is an unachieved pre-condition of a g. 
And these two things together, provide 

118
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:41,337
our result for. 
So if our flaw is an unachieved 

119
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:44,807
precondition. 
we can remove this flaw by either adding 

120
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:49,502
a cause link from an existing action or 
we add a new action and a causal link 

121
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:53,042
from that new action to our unachieved 
precondition. 

122
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:58,702
Now lets look at the case, where we have 
an action at, that is threatening a 

123
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:02,462
causal link ai to aj, protecting 
proposition p. 

124
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:08,132
And lets see how we can getResolvers, 
that remove this type of flaw from our 

125
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:11,942
partial plan. 
For an action to be a threat to a cause 

126
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:17,567
link it must be at least potentially in 
parallel to that cause link so one way to 

127
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:22,982
remove this type of flaw is to simply 
order the action either before or after 

128
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:28,491
the cause link, And we can order the 
action before the threatened link under 2 

129
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:32,109
conditions. 
The 1st 1 is that the threat must not be 

130
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:37,328
the provider and the 2nd is that it must 
not be already after the consumer. 

131
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:42,909
If neither of these 2 holds, then we can 
add an ordering at before ai and that is 

132
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:47,585
a resolver for our threat. 
The other ordering that resolves this 

133
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:52,591
threat, is to have the action come after 
the causal link or the causal link before 

134
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:55,881
the action. 
However, if our threatening action is the 

135
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:58,995
provider in our causal link, then we 
cannot use it. 

136
00:09:58,995 --> 00:10:03,591
Or similarly, if the action is already 
ordered before the provider, then we 

137
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:07,342
cannot order it after the causal link. 
In all other cases, 

138
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:12,784
ordering or threatening action after the 
consumer is a resolver for this type of 

139
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:15,871
flaw. 
The other way in which this type of flaw 

140
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:20,984
can be resolved is to add variable 
bindings such that the unifications that 

141
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:25,205
we computed earlier will fail. 
And here is how we can do that. 

142
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:30,277
Remember it is the effect q that 
threatens our proposition p here, so what 

143
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:35,551
we do is we go through every variable v 
that occurs in p or q and try to make the 

144
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:40,009
unification fail on that variable. 
So if we computed earlier our 

145
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:44,412
substitution of v must be a specific 
value, sigma of v, then. 

146
00:10:44,412 --> 00:10:48,814
Asserting that our variable v must not 
have this value is, of course, a 

147
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:53,536
potential resolver, but it is only a 
resolver if this is consistent with the 

148
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:56,634
variable bindings currently in our 
partial plan. 

149
00:10:56,634 --> 00:10:59,462
If it is consistent, then this is a 
resolver.

00:11:03,912 --> 00:11:08,684
In summary threads can be removed from a

00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:13,390
action before or after the cause of the 
link or extending the variable bindings 

153
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,493

offending effect and the protected

00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:17,493
proposition fail.
