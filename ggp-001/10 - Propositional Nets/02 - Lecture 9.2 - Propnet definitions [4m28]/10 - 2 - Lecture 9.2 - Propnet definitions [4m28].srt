1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,180
Formally we define a propositional net, or
prop net, as a directed

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,280
bipartite graph, consisting of
propositions alternating

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,320
with connectives.
In this case there are six propositions.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,230
The round circles labeled a, b, p, q, r,
and s.

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,900
And there are four connectives.

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,280
The grey and black nodes in the graph
shown here.

7
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,010
Basic prop nets, there are four types of

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,500
connectives and they're all present in
this case.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,480
There is an and gate on the upper left, an
inverter in the upper right,

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,410
an or gate on the lower right, and a
transition on the lower left.

11
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,990
Propositions are typically partitioned
into three classes.

12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,330
Input propositions, those with, are those
with no inputs.

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,370
Base propositions are those with incoming
arcs from transitions.

14
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,670
And view propositions are those with

15
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,820
incoming arcs from connectives other than
transitions.

16
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,860
In our example here, nodes a and b are
input propositions.

17
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:26,840
Note s is a base proposition, and notes p,
q, and r are view propositions.

18
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,110
An input marking, is a function from the

19
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,809
input propositions of a propositional net
to boolean values.

20
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,130
a base marking is a function from the

21
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,140
base propositions of a propositional net
boolean values.

22
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,840
And a view marking is a function from the

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,710
view propositions of a propositional net
to boolean values.

24
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,670
And we use the word marking to refer to

25
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,399
a combination of an input base and view
marking.

26
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,720
Now given a prop net, an input marking,
and a

27
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,800
base marking, determine a unique view
marking for that prop net.

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,150
This is based on the types of

29
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,800
the connectives feeding into the view
propositions.

30
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,240
The output of an inverter is true, if and
only if its input is false, for example.

31
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,680
The output of an and gate is true if and
only if all of its inputs are true.

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,500
That's suggested by the second table.

33
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,800
And the output of an or gate is true if

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,370
and only if at least one of its inputs is
true.

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,120
Transitions behave just like and gates,
except,

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,220
that there's a one step time delay.

37
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,530
The output occurs one step after the
inputs.

38
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,200
Here's an example.

39
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,150
Suppose that we had an input marking that
assigned the node

40
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,099
A, the value one, and the node B, the
value zero.

41
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,560
That's the node in the upper left and the
down node in the lower right.

42
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,440
And suppose we had a base marking that
assigned s, the value one.

43
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,030
That's the one in the lower left.

44
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,720
Then, the output of the and gate would be
a one.

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,170
The output of the inverter would be a
zero.

46
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,820
The output of the or gate would also be a
zero.

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,630
And at this point, we then have values for

48
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,242
all of the view propositions in the prop
net.

49
00:03:25,242 --> 00:03:28,140
Now let's move on to the next step.

50
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,150
Supposing once again the input is, is, has
A being one and B being zero.

51
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,970
What's the value of our base proposition
on this step?

52
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,290
Since it's the output of a transition, its
value on this step is

53
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,310
the same as the value of that transitions
input on the preceding step.

54
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,360
In this case the transition input was zero
on that preceding step as

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,669
we just saw, and so the value is zero on
this new step.

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,030
As before, we can compute the view marking
corresponding

57
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,630
to this new input marking and this new
base marking.

58
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,950
In this case, since the second input to
the and gate is now 0, the output is 0.

59
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:11,090
The output of the inverter becomes 1, and
the output of the or gate is 1 as well.

60
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,000
Now, if we leave the inputs the same, for
subsequent

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,840
steps, the prop net will go on,
alternating this way.

62
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,890
If input A ever becomes false, it will
stop

63
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,440
alternating, however the alternation will
begin again, as soon as it's set to true.
