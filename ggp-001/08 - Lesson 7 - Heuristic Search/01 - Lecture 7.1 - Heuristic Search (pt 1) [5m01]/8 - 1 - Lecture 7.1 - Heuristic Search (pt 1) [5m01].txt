In the last two lessons, we looked at
approaches to playing small games, those
games for which there is sufficient time
for a complete search of the game tree.
Unfortunately, most games are not so
small.
Incomplete search is usually impractical.
In this lesson, we'll look at a variety of
techniques for incomplete search.
We'll begin with simple Depth-Limited
Search, and after that,
we turn to two variations.
First, Fixed-Depth Heuristic and then
Variable-Depth Heuristic Search.
And in the next lesson, we examine
statistical methods for dealing with
incomplete search.
Simplest way of dealing with games, which
is too little time to
search the entire game tree, is to limit
the search in some way.
In depth-limited search, player explores
the game tree to a given depth.
Legal player is a special case of depth
limited search in
fact, as is a random player, where the
depth is effectively zero.
The imp, implementation of depth limited
search is a small variation
on the implementation of the minimax
player described in the preceding lesson.
The only difference is the addition of a
level parameter to maxscore and minscore.
Parameters incremented in minscore on each
recursive call to maxscore, as we see here
at the bottom.
and it's the level of any particular
non-terminal
state in the entry exceeds a predetermined
depth limit.
rather than expanding, maxscore simply
returns zero for that state, which
is a quite conservative lower bound on the
utility of the state.
Here
is an example of depth limited search.
By limiting the depth of players not need
to explore the entire tree,
it is still able to find a solution that
nets at 80 points.
Not as good as 100 points that it might
get if we were able to go
deeper into the tree, but it's better than
50 and, and a lot better than zero.
The most obvious problem with
depth-limited search is that the, is the
conservative estimate of zero for
non-terminal
states is really not very informative.
In the worst case, none of the states at
the given depths
may be terminal, in which case the search
provides no real value.
You just get zero everywhere.
And we're going to discuss some ways of
dealing with this
problem in the next segment, and again, in
the next lesson.
It also the opposite problem that.
The depth maybe set a too greater level,
forcing the pair to surge
deep into the tree before finding an
answer that exists at a shallow level.
This probes that's, ssss, is serious, if
along the way that
run, the player as out of time before
encountering the shallow solution.
One solution to this problem is to
use Breadth-First Search rather than
Depth-First Search.
Start off at the root,
expand one level, chec, checking each node
for termination, then we, ho.
If we halt if we ever encounter a terminal
state with sufficiently large value.
And if time expires before this happened,
we simply choose
a branch that leads to a node with highest
terminal value.
Breadth-First Search has the merit that it
finds the shortest path to a maximal goal.
And has the disadvantage that it consumes
space that's
proportional to the size of the expanding
game tree,
which can be exponential in depth.
Using this approach in some cases, the
player can run out of memory and crash.
An
alternative solution to the problem is to
use what is called iterative deepening.
Exploring the entire game tree repeatedly
at increasing depths until time runs out.
We search the tree to depth one, and then
we search the entire tree to depth two and
we search it again to depth three, and so
forth, using depth-limited search on each
of these iterations.
The primary disadvantage of this approach
is that it requires space.
Primarily advantage, I'm sorry if this
person requires place that
linear in a depth that you export portion
of the tree.
The entire sub tree does not need to be
stored,
yet it still finds the shortest path to an
optimal solution.
And the primary disadvantage is that
portions
of the tree may me explored multiple
times.
However, it's usual with iterative
deepening, this waste
is usually bounded by a small constant
factor.
Now why is that?
the size of the fringe of the tree is
approximately
the same as the size of the tree above the
fringe.
So searching the entire tree in additional
time requires only the same amount of time
as you would need to expend, to,
to explore the fringe to another level
anyway.
This means the ex, the extra there is
extra work, but it is bounded by a simple
constant factor that you can factor two or
three.
