1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,570
The, the defining characteristic of
General Game Playing is the

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,460
players don't know the rules of games
before those games begin.

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,960
Game rules are communicated only at
runtime and the players must be able to

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,690
read and understand the descriptions they
are

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,929
given in order to play legally and
effectively.

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,640
This characteristic carries with it the
requirement

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,240
of a language for writing game rules.

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,790
In general game playing, information about
games is typically

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,360
communicated to players in the formal

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,660
language called Game Description Language
or GDL.

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,360
As mentioned in the introduction, GDL is
widely used in the research literature.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,990
And it's used in virtually all general
game-playing competitions.

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,270
Moreover, it forms the basis for some more
expressive variants that have

14
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,800
significant value in real-world
applications such

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,700
as enterprise management and computational
law.

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,750
As we shall see, GDL is a logic
programming language.

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,200
Game descriptions are logic programs
consisting of

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,080
rules that define the key elements of
games.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,500
Such as initial conditions, move legality,
game

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,460
dynamics, rewards and termination and so
forth.

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,960
This lesson is an overview of GDL.

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,680
We're to begin with a detailed
introduction to logic programs in GDL.

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,510
We then look at a sample game description
and we'll look at

24
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,949
the use of this description in simulating
a match of the game.

25
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,360
Finally, we talk about some additional
requirements

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,940
on games that ensure that they are
interesting.

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,260
And we summarize the prefix syntax for

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,120
GDL used in most general game playing
competitions.
