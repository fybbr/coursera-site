1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,256
Let's look at GDL in the context of a
specific game.

2
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:11,230
namely Tic-tac-toe.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,340
As fundamental entities, we include white
and black, the roles of the game.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,340
we also include 1, 2, and 3, which are
the.

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,202
We will use this indices for rows and
columns of the Tic-tac-toe board.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,090
And we'll use x, o and b, meaning blank,
as

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,770
marks that go in the cells of the
Tic-tac-toe board.

8
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,790
we'll use the ternary function constant.

9
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:46,090
Cell together with a row index and a
column index and a mark to designate the

10
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,850
proposition that the cell in the specified
row

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,230
and column contains the specified mark or
blank.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,512
For example the data cell 2, 3, o, says
that there's

13
00:00:57,512 --> 00:01:01,040
an o in the cell in row 2 and column 3.

14
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,640
We use the unary

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,730
function constant control to say whose
turn it is to mark a cell.

16
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,060
For example, the proposition control of
white denotes

17
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,340
the proposition that it's white's turn to
play.

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,360
In Tic-tac-toe, there are only two types
of actions a player can perform.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,560
It can either mark a cell or it can do
nothing, which

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,710
is what a player does when it's not his
turn to play.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,230
The binary relation con, binary function
constant

22
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,540
mark, together with a row and a column,

23
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,240
and designates the action of playing,
placing a mark in row m and column n.

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,360
Mark place there depends on who does the
action.

25
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:43,530
And fi,

26
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,640
going back to the object constants, we
have noop

27
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
which refers to the act of doing nothing
at all.

28
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,180
Finally, we have some helper vocabulary.

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,490
row, column, diagonal, line, open.
whose purpose will become clear soon.

30
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,420
The state of the game of Tic-tac-toe was
an arbitrary subset of the propositions.

31
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,930
Propositions in a state are assumed to be
true whenever the game

32
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,520
is in that state and all others are
assumed to be false.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,260
For example, we can just describe the
Tic-tac-toe state shown here

34
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,549
on the left with the set of propositions
shown on the right.

35
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,510
cell 1, 1, contains an x, cell 2, 2,
contains an o, cell 3, 3, contains an x.

36
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,780
The other cells are all blank.

37
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,220
And it's black's turn to play.

38
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,705
Using this conceptualization of states, we
can define the game of

39
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:37,500
Tic-tac-toe with a small set of logical
sentences, as shown here.

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,020
The game has thousands of states.

41
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,510
And it can be described by just one page
of rules.

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,210
A similar parsimony is possible for other
games.

43
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,570
For example, chess is more than 10 to the
30

44
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:46,876
[INAUDIBLE]

45
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:47,210
states.

46
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:50,560
And yet, it can be described in about four
pages of rules with this search on here.

47
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,579
let's look at each of these groups of
rules in more detail.

48
00:02:56,998 --> 00:02:59,477
we first of, identified the two roles in
the

49
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:02,820
game, namely white and black, using the
role relation.

50
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,920
Next, we define the propositions in the
game.

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,390
Since there are only 29 propositions, we
could

52
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,160
do this by writing out 29 ground atoms,
however.

53
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,320
we can do this more economically by
writing just

54
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,550
two rules, as shown here, together with
some ground atoms.

55
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,597
Now, the first rule says that an
expression

56
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:30,114
of the form cell of x,y,w is true.

57
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:32,086
if x is an index, and

58
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:37,074
y is an index, and w is a filler, that is
we'll

59
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:42,400
see x over b.
And an index there is 1, 2, or 3.

60
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,056
The second rule says that a player, every
player

61
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:47,870
[INAUDIBLE],

62
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,170
that there is a proposition of the form
control of

63
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,560
w for each of the two roles in the game.

64
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,760
Now we can do the same for actions and
expression mark of x, y is an action

65
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,280
for w if w is a role and x is an index and
y is an index.

66
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,190
And noop is a possible action for either
of the two players.

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,380
Okay, here we characterize the initial
state by writing

68
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,260
all relevant propositions that are true in
the initial state.

69
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,060
In this case all cells are blank and the x
player has control.

70
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,700
Next, we then have to find legality.

71
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,890
Player may mark a cell if that cell is
blank, and it has control.

72
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,835
Otherwise, the only legal action is noop.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,280
Next, we look at the update rules for the
game.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,360
In other words it's physics.

75
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,260
It's dynamics.

76
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,980
First rule here says that a cell is marked
with an

77
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,260
x or an o if the appropriate player marks
that cell.

78
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,370
And the second rule handles the other
player.

79
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,130
If a cell is blank and is not, not marked
on that step then it remains blank.

80
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,280
The cell contains a mark.

81
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,230
It retains that mark on the subsequent
state.

82
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,770
Finally, control alternates on each play.

83
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,540
Before we get to rewards and termination,
here's some supporting concepts.

84
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,325
A row of marks means that there are

85
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:24,570
[UNKNOWN].

86
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,100
three marks all with the same first
coordinate.

87
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,320
The column and diagonal relations are
defined analgously.

88
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,526
A line is a row of marks of the same type
or column or a diagonal.

89
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,319
Finally a game is open provided there is
some cell containing a blank.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,700
Alright, here we have the definition of
goals.

91
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,100
A white player gets 100 points, since
there's a

92
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,340
line of x marks, and no line of o marks.

93
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,899
If there are no lines of either sort,
white gets 50 points.

94
00:06:01,305 --> 00:06:06,270
There's a line of o marks and no line of x
marks then white gets zero, zero points.

95
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,680
The rewards for black are analogous.

96
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,590
The final is termination.

97
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,620
The game terminates whenever either player
has a line of marks

98
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,710
of the appropriate type or if the board is
not open.

99
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,540
That is, there are no cells containing
blanks.
