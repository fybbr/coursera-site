00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,780
The main driving force of the General Game
Playing

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,228
community is the Annual International
General Game Playing Competition.

3
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:13,680
The competition is typically held in
conjunction with the

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,000
national Conference on Artificial
Intelligence sponsored by the AAAI.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,620
That's the Association for the Advancement
of Artificial Intelligence.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,360
Or sometimes it's the biennial IJCAI, and

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,358
that's the International Conference on
Artificial Intelligence.

8
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:29,120
The competition is administered by

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,230
Stanford University, so those of you who
are

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,860
at Stanford are not eligible to
participate unfortunately.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,090
The competition began in 2005, and it's
run

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,660
annually ever since, and with the
exception of 2009.

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,340
And it's been won by players from various
different

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,330
countries, including the US and Germany,
France, and Iceland.

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,270
Here's a photo of Jim Clune, the winner of
the

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,110
first GGB competition being congratulated
by the AAA president, Ron Rockman.

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,150
Jim was obviously pleased in his player
having won, or that smile might

18
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,040
be due in part to the $10,000 he received
for winning the competition.

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,110
Here we have Michael Thielscher and
Stephan Schiffel

20
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,982
from Dresden, winners of the competition
at AAAIO6.

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,690
On the left here we have Helmer Vincent
and Ing Ve Burenesen, the winners in 2007

22
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:26,760
and 8 and again in 2012.
And they're there together with Michael

23
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,200
Telsheer and stuff on and Michael Shiffer
and Michael Telsheer, the winners in 2006.

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,215
And there's Jim Clune on the right, the
winner from 2005.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,390
And finally, here we have Hilmar Finnsson
congratulating

26
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,294
a beaming Sam Schreiber at the end of
GGP-11.

27
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,560
the contest is exciting, but even the
spectators get in on the action.

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,580
Without getting into any specifics here,
let me just say that some of

29
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,740
the people, at the competition have come

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,240
away from those sessions wealthier than
beforehand.

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,650
In addition to the regular GGB competition
there's

32
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,015
now an annual battle between carbon and
silicon.

33
00:02:07,015 --> 00:02:10,130
Unfortunately for us, the beams are not
doing that well.

34
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,070
for example, 2012, Katya player handily
defeated the human race,

35
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,750
represented here by Chris Welty shown with
some of his advisors.

36
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,100
Keeping with the format of the

37
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,430
competition, the contestants play two
different games.

38
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,518
And the first Katya

39
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:31,067
player handily defeated the human in a
well played match of dual Connect Four.

40
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,400
And it then won a match of Platform
Jumpers.

41
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,130
Its consolation prize, the human was
awarded two bottles of scotch by the way.

42
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,260
In part, to ease his disappointment in
letting down the human race.
