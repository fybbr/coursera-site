00:00:03,423 --> 00:00:07,914
As we shall see, general game playing is an interesting application in its own right.

2
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:12,051
It's intellectually engaging and more than a little fun.

3
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:14,166
But it's much more than that.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:23,867
It serves as an analog for applications of logic in other areas such as business and law, science and engineering, and other areas.

5
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:33,493
More fundamentally, it raises questions about the nature of intelligence and serves as a laboratory which through evaluate competing approaches to intelligence.

6
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:43,861
Game descriptions provide full information about a world and determine optimal strategies as a baseline for evaluating agent behavior.

7
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:51,939
By its nature, the general game playing setting can be used to evaluate problem solving strategies and by extension theories of intelligence

8
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:59,032
by taking into account representation, incompleteness of information and ressource bounds.

9
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:08,816
The idea of using applications like general game playing for such purposes is not new.

10
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:14,572
It was in 1958 that John McCarty invented the concept of the "advice taker".

11
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,131
The idea was simple: he wanted a machine that he could program by description.

12
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:28,843
He would describe the intended environment and the desired goal, and the machine would use that information in determining its behavior.

13
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:31,605
There would be no programming in the traditional sense.

14
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:38,072
McCarthy presented his concept in a paper that has become a classic in the field of AI. Here is a quote:

15
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:56,652
<quote on slide>

16
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:02,679
It was an ambitious goal, but those were times of high hopes and grand ambitions.

17
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:17,070
The idea caught the imaginations of numerous subsequent researchers, notably Bob Kowalski, the high priest of logic programming, and Ed Feigenbaum, the inventor of knowledge engineering.

18
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:24,509
In a paper written in 1974, Feigenbaum gave us the most forceful statement of McCarthy's ideal:

00:02:25,992 --> 00:03:03,022

20
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:11,730
Okay so one final remark: some have argued that the way to achieve intelligent behavior is through specialization.

21
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:17,763
That may work so long as the assumptions one makes in building such a assumptions are true.

22
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:27,053
For a general intelligence however, general intellectual capabilities are needed and such systems should be capable of performing well in a wide variety of tasks.

23
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:30,351
To paraphrase the words of Robert Heinlein:

24
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:58,567

25
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:05,360
Those of us who are more interested in artificial intelligence than artificial insects agree with Heinlein.
