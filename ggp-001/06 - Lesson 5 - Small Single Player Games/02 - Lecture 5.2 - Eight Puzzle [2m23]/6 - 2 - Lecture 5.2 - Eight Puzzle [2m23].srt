00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,310
Let's begin this lesson with a look at

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,180
a common single player game called eight
puzzle.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,420
Eight puzzle is a sliding tile game.

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,260
The game board is a three by three square,

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,880
with number tiles in all but one of the
cells.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,300
The state of the game is modified by
sliding

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,670
number tiles into the empty space from
adjacent cells.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,100
Thus moving the empty space to a new
location.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,300
there are four possible moves in, at most
four possible moves.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,569
Moving empty space up, down, left or
right.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,115
Obviously not all these moves are possible
on all states.

12
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:45,440
States shown on the left and right here
illustrate

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,400
the possible moves from the state shown in
the center.

14
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,276
The tile could be moved down.

15
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:52,510
The emp, I'm sorry, the empty cell can be
moved

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,250
down, the empty cell can be moved to the
right.

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,010
The ultimate objective of the game is to
place the tiles in order,

18
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,910
and position the empty square in the lower
right cell, as shown here.

19
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,130
the game terminates after 8 moves or when
all of

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,440
the tiles are in their right positions,
whichever comes first.

21
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,020
In some versions of the game, partial
credit

22
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,020
is given for states that approximate the
ultimate goal.

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,760
With ten points being allocated for each
numbered tile in the correct position,

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,710
and 20 points being allocated for having
the empty tile in the correct position.

25
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,570
For example, the first state shown here is
worth 40 points, since

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,049
four of the cells, the ones colored green
are in their correct positions.

27
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:45,670
And the second stage on here is worth a
hundred points since all of the tiles

28
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,520
are in their correct positions, and the
empty

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,170
cell is in the lower right hand corner.

30
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,300
Now as with other games, it is possible to
describe eight puzzle in GDL.

31
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,120
Here are the rules for three puzzle, its a
version of

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,200
eight puzzle in a two by two board without
partial credit.

33
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,840
Rules for eight puzzle with partial credit
are, are very much the same,

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,010
except they're a little more verbose, and
wouldn't easily fit on a page.

35
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,906
We won't go through the details of either
rule set in

36
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:17,606
this lesson, but it may be worth your
while to pause and

37
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:20,039
look over the rules and be sure you
understand them.
