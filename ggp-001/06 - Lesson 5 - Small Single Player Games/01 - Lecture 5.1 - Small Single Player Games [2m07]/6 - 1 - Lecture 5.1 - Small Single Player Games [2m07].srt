00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:11,440
We start our in-depth tour of general game
playing by looking at single player games.

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:19,560
Such as Sudoku, or sliding tile puzzles,
Rubik's cube, and so forth.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,540
In the game playing community, these are
often called puzzles, rather than games.

4
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,010
And the process of solving such puzzles is

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,180
often called problem solving rather than
game playing.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,100
Puzzles are simpler

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,280
than multiple player games because
everything's

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,850
under the control of a single player.

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,950
World static, except when the player acts,
and changes to the world

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,040
are determined entirely by the current
state and the actions of the player.

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,600
In this lesson, as in most of the course
we

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,019
assume that the player has complete
information abut the puzzle.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,210
Assume that it knows the initial state.

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,060
You know that, it knows its legal actions
in every state.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,820
It knows the effects of its actions in
every state.

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,680
For every state, it knows its reward, and
for

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,620
every state, it knows whether or not it's
terminal.

18
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,420
In this lesson, we also assume the games
are small.

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,520
That is the player has sufficient space
and time to search the entire game tree.

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,730
This guarantees that the player can find
optimal actions to perform.

21
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:23,910
Now that said, as we'll see, it's
sometimes possible to

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,379
find optimal actions even without
searching the entire game tree.

23
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,150
Despite these strong assumptions, just one
player, complete information,

24
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,240
availability of adequate time to search
the game tree.

25
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,110
The study of single player games is a good

26
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,000
place to start our look at general game
playing.

27
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,860
First of all, many real world problems can
be

28
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,410
cast as single player games with these
same restrictions.

29
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,360
Su, such as finding possible protein

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,515
foldings as suggested by the illustration
here.

31
00:01:53,515 --> 00:01:54,940
[COUGH]

32
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,530
More importantly for us, as we'll see.

33
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,880
The techniques we examine later can be
viewed as

34
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,570
more elaborate versions of the basic
techniques introduced here.
